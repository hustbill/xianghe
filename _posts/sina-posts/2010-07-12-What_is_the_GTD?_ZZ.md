What is the GTD? ZZ
## What is the GTD? ZZ

 原文发布于：*2010-07-12 22:34:11*

GTD&reg; is the popular shorthand for "Getting Things
Done&reg;", the groundbreaking work-life management system
and [
book](https&#58;//secure.davidco.com/store/catalog/Getting-Things-Done-Paperback-Save-40-p-16175.php) by David Allen that transforms personal overwhelm and
overload into an integrated system of stress-free productivity.

Piloting a productivity seminar for a thousand managers at
Lockheed in 1983, David has continued to test and refine the
techniques and principles we now know as GTD - a powerful method to
manage commitments, information, and communication. This pioneering
and proven system is the result of those twenty plus years of
David's consulting, private coaching and organizational programs
with over a half million people internationally. GTD has well
earned its recognition as the gold standard in personal management
and productivity for many of the world's best and brightest people
and companies.

Sophisticated without being confining, the subtle effectiveness
of GTD lies in its radically common sense notion that with a
complete and current inventory of all your commitments, organized
and reviewed in a systematic way, you can focus clearly, view your
world from optimal angles and make trusted choices about what to do
(and not do) at any moment. GTD embodies an easy, step-by-step and
highly efficient method for achieving this relaxed, productive
state. It includes&#58;

- Capturing anything and everything that has your attention
- Defining actionable things discretely into outcomes and
concrete next steps
- Organizing reminders and information in the most streamlined
way, in appropriate categories, based on how and when you need to
access them
- Keeping current and "on your game" with appropriately frequent
reviews of the six horizons of your commitments (purpose, vision,
goals, areas of focus, projects, and actions)

Implementing GTD alleviates the feeling of overwhelm, instills
confidence, and releases a flood of creative energy. It provides
structure without constraint, managing details with maximum
flexibility. The system rigorously adheres to the core principles
of productivity, while allowing tremendous freedom in the "how."
The only "right" way to do GTD is getting meaningful things done
with truly the least amount of invested attention and energy.
Coaching thousands of people, where they work, about their work,
has informed the GTD method with the best practices of how to work
(and live), in that most efficient and productive way.

GTD's simplicity, flexibility, and immediacy are its attraction.
Its ability to enliven, enlighten, and empower is its magic. What,
indeed, is GTD? More than meets the eye...
