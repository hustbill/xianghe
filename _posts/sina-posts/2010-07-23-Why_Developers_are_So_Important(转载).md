### I was asked a question by [@mollsiebee](http&#58;//twitter.com/mollsiebee)
from [Fierce
Government IT](http&#58;//fiercegovernmentit.com) at the [
InformationWeek GovernmentIT Leadership Forum](http&#58;//www.informationweek.com/government/forum/index.jhtml) a couple weeks
ago, that I didn’t do a good job of responding to. The question —
as I recall — was why developers matter if people aren’t paying
attention anyhow. Ordinary citizens need access to government data
— isn’t that the point? And if nobody’s asking for it, then who
cares?

Thankfully, my hairline (and other evolutionary traits) helps
people avoid confusing me with [Steve
Ballmer](http&#58;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMU0tzLwhbE) even though my message is similar. Though there’s
probably a little less profit motive to it. I’ll explain.

Since the first information technology boom around 50,000 years
ago with the invention of speech, there have always been
information gatekeepers. Around 6,000 years ago at the dawn of
writing, these gatekeepers were called scribes. Writing was a trade
secret of professional scribes and understanding this technology
led to great power in society. Some of the really good ones were
eventually revered like gods. Check out what they have to say about
[Imhotep](http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imhotep#Birth_myths)
over in Egypt.

Fast forward a few thousand years and printers become the new
scribes. While knowledge gets further democratized with the
invention of the printing press, it still takes some capital to get
your hands on a printing press. You needed not only to get your
hands on a press, but even Johannes Gutenberg had to partner up
with a paper mill to print his bibles. Printers become powerful
folk and as literacy rates changed, the printers replaced the
scribes as the gatekeepers of information.

A few hundred years later, we freed information’s reliance on
matter learned how to turn it into energy. We invented the
telegraph, the radio and the television. Being a telegraph operator
turns out to be a great career decision in the 1900s. Thomas Edison
started out [
as a telegrapher](http&#58;//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison#Telegrapher), and went on to found General Electric which
would dominate not only the telegraph, but the entire broadcast
medium for centuries. In fact, television and radio became so
powerful that reading was being heralded as [
on the way out](http&#58;//www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/12/reading-expands-study/) in 1980 until we made the platform for
ubiquitous information consumption we call the Internet. Reading
frequency has tripled since then.

And now the masters of this new medium are developers. Like the
scribes, telegraphers and printers before them, they’re finding
keys to wealth. Let’s not forget, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry
Page, Sergey Brin, and Mark Zuckerberg aren’t writers, publishers,
or social media “experts”. They’re developers. Developers are the
new information gatekeepers, and thanks to the Internet, becoming a
skilled developer isn’t a terribly difficult skill to obtain.
Unlike the Ancient Egyptians who forbade women from becoming
scribes, anybody with a computer, connectivity and time can head
over to [peepcode](http&#58;//www.peepcode.com) and learn
Ruby.

With the pervasiveness of data among us, this means it’s
difficult for people without the ability to process vast amounts of
data to learn the truth. The amount of signal being produced by
putting printing presses in everyone’s pocket means new skills have
to be developed. As access to information becomes universal, our
definition of literacy is changing. That [
trend](http&#58;//flowingdata.com/2008/02/07/increasing-data-literacy-across-the-general-public-with-truth-and-beauty/) is [
popping](http&#58;//www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/st_thompson_statistics/)[up](http&#58;//news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10142298-16.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20)[everywhere](http&#58;//www.danah.org/papers/talks/Web2Expo.html).
Right now, developers possess the greatest ability to be [infovegans](http&#58;//infovegan.com/2010/06/18/why-infovegan/),
but what’s unique and special about them— as opposed to their
gatekeeper predecessors, is that they can build tools to allow
other people to become infovegans themselves. There’s only a slight
difference in cost between the developer making a tool for
themselves, and making a tool for everyone.

The skill of making information manageable today lays solely in
the hands of developers. So — why I keep saying that we have to get
developers involved in this government data isn’t because they are
the only ones who can make sense of the data for the rest of
society, but because developers are also the ones who can teach the
rest of society how to process the data. Developers *could*
be the final gatekeepers as we redefine literacy. If developers are
invoked with a sense of social and civic responsibility, their
ability to give people access to Truth can’t be overvalued.

Or, going back to the food metaphor&#58; for many,
it’s too difficult for people to go on an information diet. Just as
the cost of a diet of [
fresh fruits and vegetables](http&#58;//jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/135/4/900) is nearly 10x the cost of a
conventional diet the cost of a high-fact, low-opinion information
diet is too costly for most of society. Developers, as the new
gatekeepers of information, can change those economics by not only
building better tools for people to process that information, but
by making it easier to become data literate.
