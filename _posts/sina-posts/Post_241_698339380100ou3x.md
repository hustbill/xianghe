## What to keep and what to delete

A simple test for deciding whether to keep information is to ask
yourself these questions&#58;

- Does the information relate to one of your meaningful
objectives? If not, delete it.
- Can you find the information somewhere else, such as another
department, a SharePoint site, your company intranet, or the
Internet? If so, delete it.
- Are you likely to refer to the information in the next six
months? If not, delete it.
- Do you have to keep the information because it is legal or
human resources information? If not, delete it.
