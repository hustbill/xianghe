IBM Rational Clearcase 7.0: Master the Tools That Monitor,
Analyze, and Manage Software Configurations

It is a very interesting book for a Software Configuration
Manager who is interested in managing software during its
lifecycle, not only controlling it.
Authors promote command-line interface and Perl scripting as
main instrument for SCM professionals, and I just cannot resist
quoting them: "GUIs hide more than they
show".
