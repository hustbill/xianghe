4 ways to take control of your e-mail Inbox

#### 1. Set up a simple and effective e-mail reference system

The first step toward an organized Inbox is understanding the
difference between **reference information** and
**action information**.

- 
**Reference information** is information that is
**not** required to complete an action; it is
information that you want to keep in case you need it later.

- 
**Action information** is information you
**must have** to complete an action.

Most people receive a considerable amount of reference
information through e-mail. Sometimes as much as one-third of your
e-mail is reference information. So it is essential to have a
system that makes it easy to transfer messages from your Inbox into
your e-mail reference system. An E-mail Reference System is a
series of e-mail file folders where you store reference information
to ensure you have easy access to it later. Learn more about

filing your reference information, you can use the next three steps
to handle e-mail you have to do something with, your **action
information**.

#### 2. Schedule uninterrupted time to process and organize
e-mail

How many interruptions do you get every each day? It's nearly
impossible to complete anything when you allow constant
interruptions from the phone, people stopping by your office, and
instant messaging. So it's critical that you set aside
uninterrupted time to process and organize your e-mail.

Many e-mail messages require you to make a decision. Good
decisions require focus, and focus requires uninterrupted
attention. You need to establish a regular time each day to process
your e-mail so that you can empty your Inbox. Of course, you can
scan your e-mail during the day for urgent messages or requests
from your boss.

Book yourself a recurring appointment for an hour a day to
process e-mail, and mark it as "busy." During this time don't
answer the phone or take interruptions, and work only on processing
your Inbox.

At first, keeping these appointments will take discipline, but
over time the discipline becomes habit. And once you get to zero
e-mail in your Inbox, you'll see the value of this one hour a day
and you'll stick to it like glue.

#### 3. Process one item at a time, starting at the top

When you sit down to process your e-mail, the first step is to
sort it by the order in which you want to process it. For example,
you can filter by date, subject, or who the e-mail is from. In
Outlook 2003, click the **Arranged
By&#58;** box at the top of your Inbox and click
how you want to arrange your e-mail.

*Filter your e-mail by a number of different
options.*

![Tip](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/Windows/ie/images/using/icoTip.gif)

**Tip&#58;**  If you use Outlook
2003, enable the preview pane so that you can view your messages
without having to open them. To enable the preview pane, on the
**View** menu, click **AutoPreview**.

Resist the temptation to jump around in your Inbox in no
particular order. Begin processing the message at the top of your
Inbox and only move to the second one after you've handled the
first. This can be hard at first when you might have thousands of
messages in your Inbox. But as you reduce the number of messages
over a few sessions, eventually you'll get to the point where you
can process the 60-100 messages you get every day and get your
Inbox down to zero every day.

#### 4. Use the "Four D's for Decision Making" model

The "Four D's for Decision Making" model (4 D's) is a valuable
tool for processing e-mail, helping you to quickly decide what
action to take with each item and how to remove it from the
Inbox.

#### Decide what to do with each and every message

How many times have you opened, reviewed, and closed the same
e-mail message over and over? Some of those messages are getting
lots of attention but very little action. It is better to handle
each e-mail message only once before taking action—which means you
have to make a decision as to what to do with it and where to put
it. Under the 4 D's model, you have four
choices&#58;

1. 
Delete it

2. 
Do it

3. 
Delegate it

4. 
Defer it

#### DELETE IT

Generally you can delete about half of all the e-mail you get.
But some of you shudder when you hear "delete." You're hesitant to
delete messages for fear you might need them at some point. That's
understandable, but ask yourself honestly&#58; What
percentage of information that you keep do you actually use?

If you do use a large percentage of what you keep, then what
you're doing is working. But many of you are keeping a lot more
than you use. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you
decide what to delete&#58;

1. 
Does the message relate to a meaningful objective you're
currently working on? If not, you can probably **delete
it**. Why hang on to information that doesn't relate to your
main focus?

2. 
Does the message contain information you can find elsewhere? If
so, **delete it**.

3. 
Does the message contain information that you will refer to
within the next six months? If not, **delete it**.

4. 
Does the message contain information that you're required to
keep? If not, **delete it**.

#### DO IT (in less than two minutes)

If you can't DELETE IT, then decide, "What specific action do I
need to take?" and "Can I DO IT in less than two minutes?" If you
can, just DO IT.

There is no point in filing an e-mail or closing an e-mail if
you can complete it in less than 2 minutes. Try it out—see how much
mail you can process in less than 2 minutes. I think you will be
extremely surprised and happy with the results. You could file the
message, you could respond to the message, or you could make a
phone call. You can probably handle about one third of your e-mail
messages in less than two minutes.

#### DELEGATE IT

If you can't DELETE IT or DO IT in two minutes or less, can you
DELEGATE IT?

If you can delegate it, do it right away. You should be able to
compose and send the delegating message in about two minutes. Once
you delegate the action, delete the original message or move it
into your e-mail reference system.

#### DEFER IT

If you cannot DELETE IT, DO IT in less than two minutes, or
DELEGATE IT, then the action required is something that only you
can accomplish and that will take more than two minutes. Because
this is your dedicated e-mail processing time, you need to DEFER IT
and deal with it after you are done processing your e-mail. You’ll
probably find that about 10 percent of your e-mail messages have to
be deferred.

There are two things you can do to defer a
message&#58; turn it into an actionable task or turn it
into an appointment. When you're using Outlook 2003, you can DEFER
e-mails with actions by turning the e-mail into a task on your Task
List. Name the task to clearly state what action is required so
that you don't have to reopen the e-mail message. The result is a
clearly defined list of actions in your task list that you can
prioritize and schedule to complete on your Calendar. Learn how
to&#58;

#### Do it daily

Using the 4 D's model on a daily basis makes it easier to handle
a large quantity of e-mail. Our experience shows that on average,
people can process about 100 e-mail messages an hour. If you
receive 40 to 100 messages per day, all you need is one hour of
uninterrupted e-mail processing time to get through your Inbox. Our
statistics show that of the e-mail you receive&#58;

- 
50 percent can be deleted or filed

- 
30 percent can be delegated or completed in less than 2
minutes

- 
20 percent can be deferred to your Task List or Calendar to
complete later

Of course, if you have a backlog of hundreds of messages, it
will take time to get to the point where your daily routine keeps
you up to date. It's important to get that backlog down, so I would
suggest setting chunks of time aside to work through it. Then you
can really enjoy processing your messages every day using the 4
D's.
