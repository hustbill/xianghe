If you enjoyed this post, or this blog, please [make
a secure tax-deductable donation to the American Diabetes
Association](http&#58;//www.hanselman.com/fightdiabetes/donate). Please read [my
personal story about life as a diabetic](http&#58;//www.hanselman.com/fightdiabetes) and [donate
today](http&#58;//www.hanselman.com/fightdiabetes/donate).

A while back, I posted a list of [ASP.NET Interview Questions](http&#58;//www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETInterviewQuestions.aspx). [Conventional wisdom](http&#58;//www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView,guid,2d2fae59-a589-4c43-b6a5-b6ebc1a9eafd.aspx) was split, with about half the folks
saying I was nuts and that it was a list of trivia. The others said
basically "Ya, those are good. I'd probably have to look a few up."
To me, that's the right response.

Certainly I wasn't trying to boil all of .NET Software
Development down to a few simple "trivia" questions. However, I WAS
trying to get folks thinking. I believe that really good ASP.NET
(and for that matter, WinForms) is a little [read&#58;
lot] more than just draging a control onto a designer and hoping
for the best. A good race driver knows his car - what it can do and
what it can't.

So, here's another list...a greatly expanded list, for your
consumption (with attribution). I wrote this on a plane last week
on the way from Boise to Portland. I tried to take into
consideration the concerns that my lists contain unreasonable
trivia. I tried to make a list that was organized by section. If
you've never down ASP.NET, you obviously won't know all the ASP.NET
section. If you're an indenpendant consultant, you may never come
upon some of these concepts. However, ever question here has come
up more than once in the last 4 years of my time at Corillian. So,
knowing groking these questions may not make you a good or
bad developer, but it WILL save you time when problems
arise.
