## Randy Pausch in The Last Lecture

But remember, the brick walls are there for a reason. The brick
walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to
give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the
brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly
enough. They’re there to stop the other people.

- Randy Pausch in *The Last Lecture*
