![You&#039;ve&nbsp;<wbr>Got&nbsp;<wbr>Mail&nbsp;<wbr>zz](http&#58;//hiphotos.baidu.com/willsteed/pic/item/bded81fde516a43c09244db5.jpg)

When Meg Ryan's character gets the sniffles and retreats from
the world in ''You've Got Mail,'' she puts on pajamas and curls up
in bed with her trusty laptop or a favorite book. Someday, when
this cozy romantic comedy becomes a videocassette, it too will be a
comfort object perfect for such moments.

Ms. Ryan, Tom Hanks and the archly funny Nora Ephron join
forces, this time much more easily than they did in ''Sleepless in
Seattle,'' to make an inviting love story that entangles a man, a
woman, a couple of computers and a New York neighborhood so
picturesquely idealized that it feels like Paris. Even if you
already live on the Upper West Side, you might feel the urge to
move there before the film is over.

The essence of that place, its populace and this precise moment
in our technological evolution are captured so endearingly here
that ''You've Got Mail'' becomes a New York story reminiscent of
early Woody Allen romances, turning the characters into charmingly
neurotic products of the place they call home. And in this setting,
as far as ''You've Got Mail'' is concerned, the most important
landmarks are intimate little hangouts and good old-fashioned
books.

Being firmly on the side of the angels, this film treasures the
written word so proudly that the closing credits thank a long list
of publishing houses. And they really ought to be thanking Ms.
Ephron in return. The film's mix of romance and reading matter is
seductive in its own right, providing comfy book-lined settings and
people who are what they read and write. When they fall in love,
they do it wistfully, as if not quite believing that real life can
measure up to really good fiction.

The most important literary outpourings here are those exchanged
through E-mail, which makes the film that much more amusingly
attuned to its time. The screenplay by Ms. Ephron and her sister,
Delia Ephron, adapts Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 delight, ''The Shop
Around the Corner,'' to the E-mail age with gratifying ingenuity
and with its share of extra observations about how times have
changed. The star-crossed correspondents, who in Lubitsch's film
were employees of the same amazingly gracious retail establishment,
have been promoted to people who run their own businesses. That
makes their stress and loneliness all the more real, to the point
where it's easy to see what drives Joe Fox (Mr. Hanks) and Kathleen
Kelly (Ms. Ryan) into the world of cyberflirtation.

By making Kathleen the second-generation owner of a sweet little
bookstore for children (titles on the shelves have clearly been
chosen with loving care) and Joe the tycoon whose megastore may
stomp her out of business, the film gives an additional shrewd
angle to its foolproof old story.

It seems that Kathleen and Joe loathe each other in person but
are unwittingly close confidants, electronically sharing their
innermost thoughts. Should this sound merely like a lot of typing,
Ms. Ephron finds plenty of ways to put laptops in bed and otherwise
make E-mail visually interesting, starting with a nifty credit
sequence that turns all New York into the environment for a video
game. In addition, she makes time for shots at the big bookstore as
a place that sells ''cheap books and legal addictive stimulants,''
in the wry words of Mr. Hanks's Joe. That's about as nasty as Joe
needs to be under feel-good circumstances like these.

The film wafts through its urban paradise, a litter-free place
full of flowers and friendly passers-by, as it watches Kathleen and
Joe warily circling each other. Complicating matters are a few too
many supporting characters, though many of these get the
screenplay's best lines. (Says Jean Stapleton, as a genteel older
friend of Kathleen's, about an old flame&#58; ''It
wasn't meant to be. He ran Spain.'')

But the film nicely incorporates its minor figures into its
sociological milieu, like the two little children who are among
Joe's next of kin. ''Matt is my father's son,'' he explains.
''Annabel is my grandfather's daughter. We are'' pause ''an
American family.'' Dabney Coleman and John Randolph play the
much-married fathers, and at one point three generations of lonely
male Foxes find themselves luxuriously ensconced on family boats at
the 79th Street Boat Basin.

Ms. Ryan plays her role blithely and credibly this time, with an
air of freshness, a minimum of cute fidgeting and a lot of fond
chemistry with Mr. Hanks. And he continues to amaze. Once again, he
fully inhabits a new role without any obvious actorly behavior, to
the point where comparisons to James Stewart (who starred with
Margaret Sullavan in the Lubitsch film) really cannot be
avoided.

Though he has none of Mr. Stewart's lanky grace or leading-man
patina, the wonderful Mr. Hanks has all the same romantic
wistfulness and the same poignant shyness when he learns who
Kathleen really is. He shares Mr. Stewart's lovely way of speaking
from the heart. Mr. Hanks also makes fine use of the film's comic
opportunities, as in a scene that has him explaining how ''The
Godfather'' resembles the I Ching as a guide to life. ''What should
I take on vacation?'' he asks rhetorically. Advice from ''The
Godfather'' on this question goes this way&#58; ''Leave
the gun, take the cannoli.''

In a film that makes Kathleen's sensibility clear by having her
quote Joni Mitchell, the principals' erstwhile mates are part of
the trenchant local color. Parker Posey plays Joe's girlfriend, a
piranha from the publishing world (''Patricia makes coffee
nervous,'' Joe remarks), and Greg Kinnear plays a writer for The
New York Observer prone to stupefying pronouncements. These
characters are as apt a part of the scenery as Dan Davis's warm,
audience-friendly production design.

''You've Got Mail'' deserves to trigger a revived interest in
the late honey-voiced singer Harry Nilsson, whose music on the
lighthearted soundtrack provides just the right mix of jauntiness
and yearning. Mr. Nilsson's beautiful music hasn't figured this
prominently in a film since it turned up in ''Midnight Cowboy,''
used to quite different effect.
