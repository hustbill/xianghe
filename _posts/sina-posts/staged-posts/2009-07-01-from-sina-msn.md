i can show you the world

shining, shimmering, splendid

tell me, princess, now when did

you last let your heart decide

i can open your eyes

take you wonder by wonder

over, sideways and under

on a magic carpet ride

a whole new world

a new fantastic point of view

no one to tell us no or where to go

or say we're only dreaming

a whole new world

a dazzling place i never knew

but when i'm way up there

it's crystal clear

that now i'm in a whole new world

with you

--

unbelievable sights

indescribable feeling

soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

through an endless diamond sky

a whole new world

don't you dare close your eyes

a hundred thousand things to see

hold your hreath - it gets better

i'm like a shooting star i've come so far

i can't go back to where i used to be

a whole new world

with new horizons to pursue

i'll chase them anywhere

there's time to spare

let me share this whole new world

with you

a whole new world

a new fantastic point of view

no one to tell us no or where to go

or say we're only dreaming

a whole new world

(every turn a surprise)

with new horizons to pursue

(every momment red-letter)

i'll chase them anywhere

there's time to spare

## 20090717报销衍生的话题-反省自己自己的做事风格和习惯

其实我做事就是有点拖拉。所以总是得不到最好的效果，虽然我也付出相当的心血和努力，但是成绩总是逊色一点。反省再三，觉得与其让自己闲着看小说，还是不如让自己多花点时间来提升自己的效率。说到offcie2007，虽然大家能用它，但是发觉自己要真正很熟练地使用还是需要做一些私底下的训练。

今天晚上在课堂上谈运动和keep
fit，有同学提到了，做瑜伽，其实就是让自己倾听自己的学习，让整个人的心态安静下来。避免白天的浮躁和烦恼。值得一试，深呼吸本来就是咱中国气功入门第一步。

管理自己的资源，工作这么久，很容易积累自己的资源，但是由于经常丢三落四，往往以往了这些资源的存在。其实要有一个自省的心态，反复推敲和琢磨，自己究竟还多少潜能还在睡觉。需要让自己的潜能激发出来，为个人、为家庭、为这个社会、为国家创造更多的财富和价值。

ZQ居然要用Word来画鱼骨图了，我用VISIO很快搞定。哈哈

  鱼骨图的使用步骤：  

  (1)查找要解决的问题；  

  (2)把问题写在鱼骨的头上；  

  (3)召集同事共同讨论问题出现的可能原因，尽可能多地找出问题；  

  (4)把相同的问题分组，在鱼骨上标出；  

  (5)根据不同问题征求大家的意见，总结出正确的原因；  

  (6)拿出任何一个问题，研究为什么会产生这样的问题？  

  (7)针对问题的答案再问为什么？这样至少深入五个层次（连续问五个问题）；  

 
(8)当深入到第五个层次后，认为无法继续进行时，列出这些问题的原因，而后列出至少20个解决方法。  

  相互指责不能解决问题，关键在于如何找到问题的根源。  

  鱼骨图是一种发现问题解决问题的有效办法。

转发&#58; 淫欲之害

人身体的元精，散在三焦，荣华百脉；而欲火一动，就会合聚流通，都从命门中出来；

所以房事不禁的话，就像沧海那么多的水，也都会流光干掉的，所以非常的可怕啊！

凡是人的精足则神生，精神足则智虑生，人就会聪明坚强，做什么事情都会成功；

若是少年的时候，斲丧了元精，至英气全都消失掉了，那么他一生的事业也就完了啊！

人的终身疾病，都是从新婚的时候开始；因为年纪轻无知，往往放纵情欲没有节制，结果多变成了痨病，

或是身体瘦弱，甚至因此而短命死亡；连累妻子变成了寡妇，独守空闺之苦；不想百年好合的妻子，终身都陪伴著自己；

何苦从新婚开始的一个月内，就种下了一生疾病夭亡的祸根呢？

所以为人父兄，遇到子弟将要结婚的时候，应当要谆谆的教诲子弟，以此为戒啊！

俗话说：‘乐极生悲，纵欲成患。’又说：‘寡欲必多男，贪淫每无后。’

孔子说：‘血气未定，戒之在色。’老彭说：‘上士异床，中士异被，服药百颗，不如独睡。’

佛陀说：‘女色是众苦的根本，障碍的根本，杀害的根本，忧愁的根本。’

黄庭经说：‘急守精室毋妄泄，闭而保之可长活。’实在是因为淫欲会使人失去了本性，丧失了性命；

有的人暗中受到了伤害，而自己却未能察觉；有的人明明知道淫欲之害，却是不肯回头；

这就是古圣先贤为什么如此诚恳的劝导、一再提醒的原因所在啊！

凡夫俗子不知道其中的利害，肆无忌惮的放纵情欲，

因此淫秽之气，触怒了鬼神，种种不祥的灾祸，也就由此而招致。

普愿世人能够及时的很忍，就能够得到延寿健康的益处；

否则为了淫欲而牺牲了身命，这种人就没救了啊！

4 ways to take control of your e-mail Inbox

[
http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/atwork/productivity/email.aspx](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/atwork/productivity/email.aspx)

#### 1. Set up a simple and effective e-mail reference system

The first step toward an organized Inbox is understanding the
difference between **reference information** and
**action information**.

- 
**Reference information** is information that is
**not** required to complete an action; it is
information that you want to keep in case you need it later.

- 
**Action information** is information you
**must have** to complete an action.

Most people receive a considerable amount of reference
information through e-mail. Sometimes as much as one-third of your
e-mail is reference information. So it is essential to have a
system that makes it easy to transfer messages from your Inbox into
your e-mail reference system. An E-mail Reference System is a
series of e-mail file folders where you store reference information
to ensure you have easy access to it later. Learn more about
[
setting up an E-mail Reference System](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX011456171033.aspx). Once you take care of
filing your reference information, you can use the next three steps
to handle e-mail you have to do something with, your **action
information**.

#### 2. Schedule uninterrupted time to process and organize
e-mail

How many interruptions do you get every each day? It's nearly
impossible to complete anything when you allow constant
interruptions from the phone, people stopping by your office, and
instant messaging. So it's critical that you set aside
uninterrupted time to process and organize your e-mail.

Many e-mail messages require you to make a decision. Good
decisions require focus, and focus requires uninterrupted
attention. You need to establish a regular time each day to process
your e-mail so that you can empty your Inbox. Of course, you can
scan your e-mail during the day for urgent messages or requests
from your boss.

Book yourself a recurring appointment for an hour a day to
process e-mail, and mark it as "busy." During this time don't
answer the phone or take interruptions, and work only on processing
your Inbox.

At first, keeping these appointments will take discipline, but
over time the discipline becomes habit. And once you get to zero
e-mail in your Inbox, you'll see the value of this one hour a day
and you'll stick to it like glue.

#### 3. Process one item at a time, starting at the top

When you sit down to process your e-mail, the first step is to
sort it by the order in which you want to process it. For example,
you can filter by date, subject, or who the e-mail is from. In
Outlook 2003, click the **Arranged
By&#58;** box at the top of your Inbox and click
how you want to arrange your e-mail.

![Image of how you can filter your e-mail with Outlook 2003](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/global/atwork/PublishingImages/productivity/57288_138x210_arrangeby_F.jpg)

*Filter your e-mail by a number of different
options.*

![Tip](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/Windows/ie/images/using/icoTip.gif)

**Tip&#58;**  If you use Outlook
2003, enable the preview pane so that you can view your messages
without having to open them. To enable the preview pane, on the
**View** menu, click **AutoPreview**.

Resist the temptation to jump around in your Inbox in no
particular order. Begin processing the message at the top of your
Inbox and only move to the second one after you've handled the
first. This can be hard at first when you might have thousands of
messages in your Inbox. But as you reduce the number of messages
over a few sessions, eventually you'll get to the point where you
can process the 60-100 messages you get every day and get your
Inbox down to zero every day.

#### 4. Use the "Four D's for Decision Making" model

The "Four D's for Decision Making" model (4 D's) is a valuable
tool for processing e-mail, helping you to quickly decide what
action to take with each item and how to remove it from the
Inbox.

#### Decide what to do with each and every message

How many times have you opened, reviewed, and closed the same
e-mail message over and over? Some of those messages are getting
lots of attention but very little action. It is better to handle
each e-mail message only once before taking action—which means you
have to make a decision as to what to do with it and where to put
it. Under the 4 D's model, you have four
choices&#58;

1. 
Delete it

2. 
Do it

3. 
Delegate it

4. 
Defer it

#### DELETE IT

Generally you can delete about half of all the e-mail you get.
But some of you shudder when you hear "delete." You're hesitant to
delete messages for fear you might need them at some point. That's
understandable, but ask yourself honestly&#58; What
percentage of information that you keep do you actually use?

If you do use a large percentage of what you keep, then what
you're doing is working. But many of you are keeping a lot more
than you use. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you
decide what to delete&#58;

1. 
Does the message relate to a meaningful objective you're
currently working on? If not, you can probably **delete
it**. Why hang on to information that doesn't relate to your
main focus?

2. 
Does the message contain information you can find elsewhere? If
so, **delete it**.

3. 
Does the message contain information that you will refer to
within the next six months? If not, **delete it**.

4. 
Does the message contain information that you're required to
keep? If not, **delete it**.

#### DO IT (in less than two minutes)

If you can't DELETE IT, then decide, "What specific action do I
need to take?" and "Can I DO IT in less than two minutes?" If you
can, just DO IT.

There is no point in filing an e-mail or closing an e-mail if
you can complete it in less than 2 minutes. Try it out—see how much
mail you can process in less than 2 minutes. I think you will be
extremely surprised and happy with the results. You could file the
message, you could respond to the message, or you could make a
phone call. You can probably handle about one third of your e-mail
messages in less than two minutes.

#### DELEGATE IT

If you can't DELETE IT or DO IT in two minutes or less, can you
DELEGATE IT?

If you can delegate it, do it right away. You should be able to
compose and send the delegating message in about two minutes. Once
you delegate the action, delete the original message or move it
into your e-mail reference system.

#### DEFER IT

If you cannot DELETE IT, DO IT in less than two minutes, or
DELEGATE IT, then the action required is something that only you
can accomplish and that will take more than two minutes. Because
this is your dedicated e-mail processing time, you need to DEFER IT
and deal with it after you are done processing your e-mail. You’ll
probably find that about 10 percent of your e-mail messages have to
be deferred.

There are two things you can do to defer a
message&#58; turn it into an actionable task or turn it
into an appointment. When you're using Outlook 2003, you can DEFER
e-mails with actions by turning the e-mail into a task on your Task
List. Name the task to clearly state what action is required so
that you don't have to reopen the e-mail message. The result is a
clearly defined list of actions in your task list that you can
prioritize and schedule to complete on your Calendar. Learn how
to&#58;

- 
[
Turn a message into a task](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP030641671033.aspx)

- 
[
Turn a message into a meeting request](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP030641641033.aspx)

#### Do it daily

Using the 4 D's model on a daily basis makes it easier to handle
a large quantity of e-mail. Our experience shows that on average,
people can process about 100 e-mail messages an hour. If you
receive 40 to 100 messages per day, all you need is one hour of
uninterrupted e-mail processing time to get through your Inbox. Our
statistics show that of the e-mail you receive&#58;

- 
50 percent can be deleted or filed

- 
30 percent can be delegated or completed in less than 2
minutes

- 
20 percent can be deferred to your Task List or Calendar to
complete later

Of course, if you have a backlog of hundreds of messages, it
will take time to get to the point where your daily routine keeps
you up to date. It's important to get that backlog down, so I would
suggest setting chunks of time aside to work through it. Then you
can really enjoy processing your messages every day using the 4
D's.


5 beliefs that limit productivity—and how to overcome them (By Microsoft)
## 5 beliefs that limit productivity—and how to overcome them (By Microsoft)

 原文发布于：*2009-07-19 10:12:25*

### When I work with people in my business productivity practice,
the first question I ask them is, "What's stopping you from being
more productive?" The answers that keep coming up are pretty much
the same from everyone.

In this article, we'll take a look at these beliefs one by one,
and see how you can turn them around.

#### 1. There's too much information coming at me too fast

**Belief&#58;** My e-mail is
overwhelming me. I can't keep up with it.

**Reality&#58;** The volume of e-mail
isn't the issue. *How you process and organize the volume*
is the issue. Learning how to better manage your e-mail by using
McGhee Productivity Solutions' "Four D's for Decision Making" will
transform this belief.

Each year we receive more and more data from a growing array of
devices, which can be accessed from an increasing number of
locations. If you're not careful, the quantity of data starts to
drive you instead of the other way around. [
Learn 4 ways you can take control of your e-mail Inbox](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/atwork/productivity/email.aspx). And
when you do, you can reduce the number of messages in your inbox by
as much as 80 percent.

#### 2. I have to keep everything

**Belief&#58;** I have to keep
everything. You just never know when you might need it!

**Reality&#58;** Okay, prepare
yourself. On average, the clients we work with throw away 50
percent of their stored information, with no ramifications. They
feel lighter, happier, and have more time. So if you're a "keeper,"
and you know who you are, hold on to your hats! You "keepers" are a
proud and experienced breed! There's nothing quite like laying your
hands on a file that no one else can find. It justifies all of your
filing and keeping efforts. If you're a keeper, you might recognize
yourself in one of these statements&#58;

- 
I got badly burned when I couldn't lay my hands on an important
document. Now, I'm afraid to let go of information.

- 
I want to be able to justify the decisions I make, so I keep
everything.

- 
If my system crashes, I want backup information.

- 
I felt so good when no one else could find "that document." As a
result, I decided to keep everything so I could continue being
useful.

At some point you made a decision about keeping all your
information. That decision has been driving you ever since, but it
may not be appropriate in your current situation.

The truth is, most people use only 15 percent of what they file,
and this makes the other 85 percent ineffective. You can read about
one way to develop a functional filing system in my [
Create an Effective Reference System](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX011456171033.aspx) article. By clarifying
what is useful and letting go of the rest, you can reduce your
filing, make it easier to find what you do keep, and save valuable
time and energy that you can direct to more meaningful tasks. Also,
[
learn 7 tips to help you manage your files better](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/atwork/productivity/files.aspx).

#### 3. Organization cramps my freedom and creativity

**Belief&#58;** Being organized blocks
my creativity, and there's nothing spontaneous about it.

**Reality&#58;** Organization actually
fosters and supports creativity and spontaneity. You may find your
creativity being disrupted by the non-stop flood of reminders
spinning around your head, such as&#58;

- 
Call Kevin for his birthday

- 
Review the P&L spreadsheet

- 
Review PowerPoint slide deck

- 
Decide on a Valentine's Day present

Imagine if you could clear your mind of all these lists and
transfer them to Microsoft Office Outlook. You can do this by
putting them in the TaskPad. This will create space for new ideas
and creative thinking. Being disorganized can also stifle your
creativity. Imagine you're an artist and decide to paint the
Colorado autumn colors in Aspen. You drive for three and a half
hours from Denver to Aspen to find the perfect spot. When you
arrive, you realize you've forgotten to pack your paint brushes.
That can make being creative really hard! Preparation does support
your creativity.

When your calendar is booked and leaves no time to be
spontaneous, this can be frustrating. However, if you pre-plan, you
can block out large chunks of time with no organized events, giving
you more freedom to do something on the spur of the moment.

To get control of all the "stuff" in your life, I recommend you
set up an Integrated Management System (IMS). An IMS gives you a
methodology for storing reference information, turning action
information into tasks, and scheduling tasks on your calendar.
After you've set up your IMS, you'll find that it will support your
creativity and spontaneity. The best result is being able to close
your system, knowing that everything is taken care of so you can
relax and let go!

#### 4. There's not enough time in the day!

**Belief&#58;** I just don't have the
time to do all the things I want.

**Reality&#58;** Time is not the issue.
The issue is deciding what you can do given the time you have.

As you know, managing your time with Olympian skill doesn't
create more hours in the day. We all have the same 24 hours, so the
issue isn't managing time—it's managing what you can do with the
time you have. You can't do everything, but you can do anything, as
long as it fits into your calendar.

If you keep your to-do lists in multiple locations—in e-mail, on
a calendar, on paper, in an Excel spreadsheet, a list in your head,
and notepad paper—you might want to consider centralizing this list
in the Outlook TaskPad. This will make it easier to centralize and
prioritize this list. Then, you need to schedule your tasks on your
Outlook Calendar so you will know what you can and can not do. To
start, put your to-do items on your Outlook Task list. [
Learn how to create a Task](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP052429701033.aspx).

![Example of a task list](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/global/atwork/PublishingImages/productivity/taskpad.jpg)

*Create a task list to see all the commitments you
have.*

Then, drag your tasks onto your Outlook Calendar.

If you click on a task and drag it to the Calendar, you can
choose to move or copy it to your Calendar as an attachment, with
all of the details intact.

![Example of moving your tasks to your calendar](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/global/atwork/PublishingImages/productivity/taskpad2.jpg)

*View all your tasks on your calendar.*

As you drop tasks into the available time on your Calendar you
will immediately see if you are overcommitted and if you need to
re-prioritize your tasks and, in some cases, reschedule your
commitments.

#### 5. It takes too much time to get productive

**Belief&#58;** I don't have the time
to set up a system. I've got too much to do.

**Reality&#58;** You can save one to
two hours a day using an Integrated Management System, so the
return on the investment is significant.

Here are some interesting statistics. On average, people we work
with spend two to three hours a day working in e-mail and 60
minutes a day finding and filing information. After setting up an
Integrated Management System, they spend one to two hours a day
working in e-mail and 10 minutes a day finding and filing
information. That's a savings of nearly two hours a day, or almost
12 weeks a year! The bottom line is&#58; You can't
afford not to create an effective Integrated Management System.

Take a moment and consider the time you
spend&#58;

- 
Finding and filing information;

- 
Writing a to-do list, and then rewriting it a week later on
another list, and then another;

- 
Opening e-mail, reading the message, closing the e-mail and then
coming back to the same e-mail to read it again tomorrow; and

- 
Going to the store and realizing you don't know the model of the
hardware you need to pick up.

These are just a few examples of how we waste time by not having
an Integrated Management System to help us remember what, where,
and when. Take the time to set up your system. You're worth it, and
you can't afford not to.

What to keep and what to delete
## What to keep and what to delete

 原文发布于：*2009-07-19 10:02:14*

A simple test for deciding whether to keep information is to ask
yourself these questions&#58;

- Does the information relate to one of your meaningful

玩转word2007 Style
## 玩转word2007 Style

 原文发布于：*2009-07-25 11:03:11*

在word2007中修改style不如2003得心应手，索性在微软的网站找了几个文档模板，尝试了用这些模板作为QuickStyles保存,放在路径C&#58;\Documents
and Settings\zhangb\Application
Data\Microsoft\QuickStyles下，以后写文档就直接用自己保存的style，非常省事了。

具体做法： Change Styles &ndash;>Style Set->
Save as Quick Style Set &ndash;> Save your
dox&#58; XXX-template.dotx

当然，如果超级喜欢某个Style，可以直接Set as Default.
