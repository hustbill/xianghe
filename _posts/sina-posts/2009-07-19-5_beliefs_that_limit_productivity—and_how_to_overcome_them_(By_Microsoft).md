5 beliefs that limit productivity—and how to overcome them (By Microsoft)
## 5 beliefs that limit productivity—and how to overcome them (By Microsoft)

 原文发布于：*2009-07-19 10:12:25*

### When I work with people in my business productivity practice,
the first question I ask them is, "What's stopping you from being
more productive?" The answers that keep coming up are pretty much
the same from everyone.

In this article, we'll take a look at these beliefs one by one,
and see how you can turn them around.

#### 1. There's too much information coming at me too fast

**Belief&#58;** My e-mail is
overwhelming me. I can't keep up with it.

**Reality&#58;** The volume of e-mail
isn't the issue. *How you process and organize the volume*
is the issue. Learning how to better manage your e-mail by using
McGhee Productivity Solutions' "Four D's for Decision Making" will
transform this belief.

Each year we receive more and more data from a growing array of
devices, which can be accessed from an increasing number of
locations. If you're not careful, the quantity of data starts to
drive you instead of the other way around. [

when you do, you can reduce the number of messages in your inbox by
as much as 80 percent.

#### 2. I have to keep everything

**Belief&#58;** I have to keep
everything. You just never know when you might need it!

**Reality&#58;** Okay, prepare
yourself. On average, the clients we work with throw away 50
percent of their stored information, with no ramifications. They
feel lighter, happier, and have more time. So if you're a "keeper,"
and you know who you are, hold on to your hats! You "keepers" are a
proud and experienced breed! There's nothing quite like laying your
hands on a file that no one else can find. It justifies all of your
filing and keeping efforts. If you're a keeper, you might recognize
yourself in one of these statements&#58;

- 
I got badly burned when I couldn't lay my hands on an important
document. Now, I'm afraid to let go of information.

- 
I want to be able to justify the decisions I make, so I keep
everything.

- 
If my system crashes, I want backup information.

- 
I felt so good when no one else could find "that document." As a
result, I decided to keep everything so I could continue being
useful.

At some point you made a decision about keeping all your
information. That decision has been driving you ever since, but it
may not be appropriate in your current situation.

The truth is, most people use only 15 percent of what they file,
and this makes the other 85 percent ineffective. You can read about
one way to develop a functional filing system in my [
Create an Effective Reference System](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX011456171033.aspx) article. By clarifying
what is useful and letting go of the rest, you can reduce your
filing, make it easier to find what you do keep, and save valuable
time and energy that you can direct to more meaningful tasks. Also,

#### 3. Organization cramps my freedom and creativity

**Belief&#58;** Being organized blocks
my creativity, and there's nothing spontaneous about it.

**Reality&#58;** Organization actually
fosters and supports creativity and spontaneity. You may find your
creativity being disrupted by the non-stop flood of reminders
spinning around your head, such as&#58;

- 
Call Kevin for his birthday

- 
Review the P&L spreadsheet

- 
Review PowerPoint slide deck

- 
Decide on a Valentine's Day present

Imagine if you could clear your mind of all these lists and
transfer them to Microsoft Office Outlook. You can do this by
putting them in the TaskPad. This will create space for new ideas
and creative thinking. Being disorganized can also stifle your
creativity. Imagine you're an artist and decide to paint the
Colorado autumn colors in Aspen. You drive for three and a half
hours from Denver to Aspen to find the perfect spot. When you
arrive, you realize you've forgotten to pack your paint brushes.
That can make being creative really hard! Preparation does support
your creativity.

When your calendar is booked and leaves no time to be
spontaneous, this can be frustrating. However, if you pre-plan, you
can block out large chunks of time with no organized events, giving
you more freedom to do something on the spur of the moment.

To get control of all the "stuff" in your life, I recommend you
set up an Integrated Management System (IMS). An IMS gives you a
methodology for storing reference information, turning action
information into tasks, and scheduling tasks on your calendar.
After you've set up your IMS, you'll find that it will support your
creativity and spontaneity. The best result is being able to close
your system, knowing that everything is taken care of so you can
relax and let go!

#### 4. There's not enough time in the day!

**Belief&#58;** I just don't have the
time to do all the things I want.

**Reality&#58;** Time is not the issue.
The issue is deciding what you can do given the time you have.

As you know, managing your time with Olympian skill doesn't
create more hours in the day. We all have the same 24 hours, so the
issue isn't managing time—it's managing what you can do with the
time you have. You can't do everything, but you can do anything, as
long as it fits into your calendar.

If you keep your to-do lists in multiple locations—in e-mail, on
a calendar, on paper, in an Excel spreadsheet, a list in your head,
and notepad paper—you might want to consider centralizing this list
in the Outlook TaskPad. This will make it easier to centralize and
prioritize this list. Then, you need to schedule your tasks on your
Outlook Calendar so you will know what you can and can not do. To
start, put your to-do items on your Outlook Task list. [
Learn how to create a Task](http&#58;//office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HP052429701033.aspx).

![Example of a task list](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/global/atwork/PublishingImages/productivity/taskpad.jpg)

*Create a task list to see all the commitments you
have.*

Then, drag your tasks onto your Outlook Calendar.

If you click on a task and drag it to the Calendar, you can
choose to move or copy it to your Calendar as an attachment, with
all of the details intact.

![Example of moving your tasks to your calendar](http&#58;//www.microsoft.com/global/atwork/PublishingImages/productivity/taskpad2.jpg)

*View all your tasks on your calendar.*

As you drop tasks into the available time on your Calendar you
will immediately see if you are overcommitted and if you need to
re-prioritize your tasks and, in some cases, reschedule your
commitments.

#### 5. It takes too much time to get productive

**Belief&#58;** I don't have the time
to set up a system. I've got too much to do.

**Reality&#58;** You can save one to
two hours a day using an Integrated Management System, so the
return on the investment is significant.

Here are some interesting statistics. On average, people we work
with spend two to three hours a day working in e-mail and 60
minutes a day finding and filing information. After setting up an
Integrated Management System, they spend one to two hours a day
working in e-mail and 10 minutes a day finding and filing
information. That's a savings of nearly two hours a day, or almost
12 weeks a year! The bottom line is&#58; You can't
afford not to create an effective Integrated Management System.

Take a moment and consider the time you
spend&#58;

- 
Finding and filing information;

- 
Writing a to-do list, and then rewriting it a week later on
another list, and then another;

- 
Opening e-mail, reading the message, closing the e-mail and then
coming back to the same e-mail to read it again tomorrow; and

- 
Going to the store and realizing you don't know the model of the
hardware you need to pick up.

These are just a few examples of how we waste time by not having
an Integrated Management System to help us remember what, where,
and when. Take the time to set up your system. You're worth it, and
you can't afford not to.
