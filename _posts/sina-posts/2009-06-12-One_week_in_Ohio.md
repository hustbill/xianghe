One week in Ohio
## One week in Ohio

Some wrong with my Chinese input. So I have no choice to write
my log in english. It is a challenge to me. 

Monday, I’m homesick, very tied. so have no process for my
training.

Tuesday, I also get up earily. So, on the afternoon, I’m eager
to sleep.

Wenesday, everthing runs well as normally. Shawn, Ray and I go
to the bookstore to search and read books.

Thursday, the food is delicious .

 

That’s all.

Just like child’s words. &#58;-)
