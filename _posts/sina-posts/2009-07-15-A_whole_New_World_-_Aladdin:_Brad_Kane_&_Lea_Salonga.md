i can show you the world

shining, shimmering, splendid

tell me, princess, now when did

you last let your heart decide

i can open your eyes

take you wonder by wonder

over, sideways and under

on a magic carpet ride

a whole new world

a new fantastic point of view

no one to tell us no or where to go

or say we're only dreaming

a whole new world

a dazzling place i never knew

but when i'm way up there

it's crystal clear

that now i'm in a whole new world

with you

--

unbelievable sights

indescribable feeling

soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

through an endless diamond sky

a whole new world

don't you dare close your eyes

a hundred thousand things to see

hold your hreath - it gets better

i'm like a shooting star i've come so far

i can't go back to where i used to be

a whole new world

with new horizons to pursue

i'll chase them anywhere

there's time to spare

let me share this whole new world

with you

----

a whole new world

a new fantastic point of view

no one to tell us no or where to go

or say we're only dreaming

a whole new world

(every turn a surprise)

with new horizons to pursue

(every momment red-letter)

i'll chase them anywhere

there's time to spare

anywhere

there's time to spare

let me share this whole new world

with you

a whole new world

that's where we'll be

a thrilling chase

a wondrous place

for you and me
