## 和领英创始人Reid Hoffman一起工作的10000个小时

Original 刚开张的 [胖福馒头](javascript:void(0);) 2021-03-27

Reid Hoffman（里德 · 霍夫曼）是近两年对我启发和影响最大的人。他是Paypal黑帮的主要成员之一，世界最大的职场社交平台领英的缔造者，被誉为“硅谷人脉王”，同时也是硅谷风投机构Greylock的合伙人，多本创投畅销书作者。多个身份看似分离，却是相互连接、协同成就。

Reid吸引我的不是这些标签，而是他始终充满创造性的思想。人生的价值有两种，一种是安于个人生活，享受当下美好；一种是竭尽所能为世界创造更大的价值。Reid显然对后者有执着的追求，他会一遍一遍思考——在刚刚过去的2个小时里是否做了什么让这个世界变得更有价值。这个选择背后折射的是Reid Hoffman的人生算法、原则和价值观。

这篇文章的作者Ben Casnocha，他曾是Reid团队的幕僚长（Chief of Staff，简称COS），和Reid朝夕相处超过4年，他们一起完成了《联盟》、《至关重要的关系》两本广为流传的经典书籍。在和Reid一同工作的4年里，Ben最享受的部分是深夜航班上与Reid的对话。“无论Reid脑海里有什么想法，Ben都给出我最真挚坦诚的建议”，当Reid思考着那些激发他生命的大大小小的问题时，Ben也尽力表现出一个军师兼对话者的素养。

就像Ben描述一个二人对话的场景，“从拉斯维加斯返回位于圣何塞的夜晚，飞机上除了前头的两名飞行员，只有Reid和我，我们复盘了刚刚的科技活动上他发表的演讲中有用的和没用的观点。我很快对他提出的关于领英愿景的问题给出了反馈。而他重新回答了Greylock与其他风险投资公司的不同之处，我也记下了笔记。”

一定程度上Ben是这个星球上最了解Reid的人之一。我一直觉得通过外界信息了解一个人是相对片面的，Ben于我而言是我学习Reid Hoffman的一个窗口。

Ben在这篇文章中回顾了与Reid四年朝夕相处中的点点滴滴，总结了16条具有普适性的Reid Hoffman人生经验，我从中受益匪浅，也同样希望内容能给大家带来启发和收获。

人是复杂且有缺点的。要赞美他们更天使的一面




很多人总是容易非黑即白地评价他人的能力或性格：他很聪明或是他就是个傻瓜。她心地善良或者她是个混蛋。他是个道德卫士或者是个不惜一切代价的骗子。这样的方式很不合理。每个人的专业知识都是相对的。

就像奥斯卡.王尔德说的那样，每个圣人都有过去，每个罪人也有未来。人性是复杂的。

Reid以“人脉王”被熟知。他有一个天赋，那就是对于他认识的人，他能够了解其复杂人格。他欣赏一个人的长处和短处。他会评价一个朋友的性格弱点，比如，以自我为中心；但下一秒，他就会转到他们独特的优点上。

通过这种方法，Reid原谅朋友们犯的错。如果你犯了一个错（或者三个），或者你暴露了一个缺点——你们的关系并没有玩完。这只是一段长久关系中的小涟漪。

Reid的一个好朋友曾说服他去纽约参加一个特别的活动。后来，我问他此行如何？他当时回我“这真是浪费时间的愚蠢行为”。然而，就在第二个星期，他和这个朋友又打了电话，并且开始计划下一次合作了。他极少让单个错误或缺点抹掉成功或功劳。他总是支持人天使美好的那一面。难怪他的朋友们都对他如此忠诚。

这种哲学让我想起了我已故的朋友塞斯·罗伯茨，他提倡“欣赏”的方式面对人生。在评价一个人的时候，不要从他们的缺点开始，先看他们有什么独特的优点。在评估一项研究时，不要直接批评其缺陷，先问我们能从中学到什么。

让欣赏的态度渗透到你所做的一切。

获得大人物关注的最好方法是：主动提供帮助




作为COS（其实某种意义上也就是Reid的助手），我审查了成千上万个申请，这些请求信大多需要Reid投入时间/精力/金钱。他们要么期望获得他的注意，要么想从他那里获得投资。令人惊讶的是，几乎没有人主动提出能够帮助Reid做些什么。很多请求信写得反而像是他们帮了Reid一个大忙似的，因为他们给了Reid机会Reid才能提供帮助：“如果你给我的项目一些反馈，我将会很开心的。”Reid非常慷慨且充满好奇心，所以才会帮你。但是为什么不弄清楚他的工作，发送一篇参考文章呢？或者分享一个可能有用的观点。

很多人都认为像Reid和比尔盖茨这样有名又有钱的人，他们帮不上什么忙。让我们思考一下。你该怎么帮助比尔盖茨呢？

向他的慈善事业捐款不会有用，你也没有能够介绍给他而他认识不到的人。购买微软产品对他的帮助也不大。但是实际上，盖茨渴求而你可能拥有的，是信息。你的独特的视角，以及对发生在你周围的事情的看法，这些东西是他买不到的。如果你能够将你知道的信息和盖茨需要的联系在一起，假设你10 岁的表弟痴迷于一款可能引导计算机潮流的 App，他会发现价值，你则更有可能和盖茨建立关系。至少，这是一个和索求完全相反的姿态。

重要的事情说三次：帮助为先，帮助为先，帮助为先。

主动提供帮助堪称是建立一切关系的不二法门。

当构想战略和做决定时，保证简洁明了且快速执行。




Reid是个战略家。但是，他不是个可以一字不差背诵出克雷.克里斯坦森和迈克尔.波特理论的人。事实上，Reid从未正式学习过战略，也很少引用著名大师的名言。相反，他的策略来自于经验和来之不易的创业环境：这个环境前途未卜、瞬息万变，一步迈错，就有可能粉身碎骨。当然，在”不可思议的时代“（这是他最喜欢的一本书），其实所有公司都在这样的环境中挣扎，不止是创业公司。

| **速度**

他的第一原则是“速度”。

他最出名的名言是，*“If you aren’t embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late.”* “如果你第一版的产品没让你出洋相，那你产品面市的时间其实已经晚了。”

他第二个广为人知的话，*“In founding a startup, you throw yourself off a cliff and build an airplane on the way down.”* “创业就像跳下悬崖，在下落过程中组装飞机接住自己。”

实际上，他雇佣了几个决策专家提升速度以作出最优的选择——同时加速决策的过程。当面对一组选择时，他经常基于当前信息本能地作出快速决定。然后，他会注意到他还差什么额外信息，以此反驳他的决定。而这世界上大多数人，做决定的方式和他相反。在遇到信息有限的情况时，很多人都在等，非要收集到更多信息才做决定。但在此期间，世界早就变了。

如果你迅速行动，会有因匆匆决定导致的错误。如果你是一个非常注重时效的经理，那你需要告诉你的人：我愿意接受因为决定太快而带来的成本。

Reid就是这么做的，他让我有权自行决定一些事务，而不必经过他的同意。他对我说，“如果你能提高处理问题的速度，我甚至容许10-20%的出错率，只要你的速度能更快。”这个比率，给了我难以置信的自由。

对创业公司来说，速度非常重要。大公司不一样。Reid曾告诉我，像 LinkedIn 领英这样的大公司的最关键不是追求速度上的策略。相反，他们需要制定策略，使缓慢成为力量。

| **简单**

Reid做决定的第二个原则是“简单”。

简单成就速度。

在存在许多可能的情况下，他经常把方案分组为：“轻度、中度和重度”或者是“简单，中等，困难”。例如，当我们在讨论领英B轮融资计划书时，我们原本可以点击发布、分享到领英和推特，看看传播效果如何就行了。我们也可以提前联系记者，单独透露一些内容。或者我们可以写一系列文章，同期发布。甚至，我们能录下他对这个幻灯片的评论。而Reid最终把选项分为三类：基础、中级、高级。“我们到底想要从这件事中获得什么？”在此基础上，我们决定了执行相关操作的强度。

当采取某个行动牵扯的利弊非常复杂时，Reid会寻找一个最具决定性因素，而非多个混合因素一起考虑。比如，我们曾讨论他某次去中国出差是否有意义。当时，中国有领英的扩张活动，中国科技产业也正在经历有趣的改变，还有就是《至关重要的关系》中文版的发布，这些理由都非常值得去一趟中国。但Reid认为，“还需要一个决定性理由。这趟旅行是否值得，需要用那个理由衡量。其他的所有安排，是否值得因此推迟。如果我是因为一堆杂七杂八的理由才去的，那我回来之后肯定会觉得这次旅行完全是在浪费时间。”最后Reid没有去。

Nassim Taleb有言：*you are trying to convince yourself—if there isn’t one clear reason, don’t do it.* 当决定做某事时，如非有一个明确清晰的理由，我不会去做。（在投资面向消费者的网络业务模式时，Reid也有个类似思考方式，这家公司必须有一个主导的商业模式，太多可能的收入来源，反而会让投资者不相信。）



让复杂变简单，并不意味忽略复杂性。Reid从来也不会放过任何细节，他同时也会考虑二阶效应、例外情况等等。但在团队决策过程中，尤其是在有不同观点的情况下，领导者很重要的一点是，要简明扼要地提炼和选择是非常重要的，最终作出一个足够简单到每个人都能理解和执行的决定。

简单也能转化为专注。他曾告诉我，他与一个坚持多年的创业者有过一次不太好的对话经历，该创业者为一个项目规划了多个阶段的愿景，这个项目持续了几年时间。他认为，这个人“没有抓住重点”。Reid告诉我，“往往你没有走好第一步，你就出局了。没有什么比这个更重要的，其他后面的事都不重要了。他就应该全心专注于第一阶段。”

创业到处都是磨难，保持简单：把注意力集中在最重要的难点上。

| **赋能**

让执行层面的人有机会决定战略。

许多战略家（和CEO ）认为工作是构想一个策略，并让下属去执行。他们可能会承认授予决策权很重要，但这通常是执行的问题，而不是战略的问题。

Reid不同意。他说，“每一个真正制定策略的人，都要想办法让策略变得更好。”这也是对人才的试金石：你如何知道你的项目团队中有一流人才？你会知道他们是否会一股脑不思考就直接接受任务。根据他们对细节的了解程度，他们应该提出修改计划的建议。当他们执行时，他们应该继续调整战略。在执行时，他们可以持续追踪方案效果，而你（老板）就不要事无巨细地过度管理了。

每一个缺点都有一个对应的优点。




有一天，我和Reid坐下来，分享了我对自己工作、目标、优缺点的自我评价。当谈到如何弥补缺点时，Reid建议：“大多数优点都有对应的缺点。如果你尝试修正一个人的缺点，你可能也会顺手掩盖了对方的优点。”

他分享了一个关于他自己的例子。他不是特别有条理的人，但可能正是这种混乱，激发了他的创造力，并将无数个不同的想法联系起来。他是一个不停地冒出新想法的人——也许他生活中无拘无束的节奏是一种积极的力量。你的人生越是一丝不苟、严格规划，可能你的创造性就越弱，这是一枚硬币的两面。

另一个例子：他对朋友的忠诚和慷慨是他的优点。朋友对他很重要，他对他的朋友也很重要，他和朋友们合作的精彩成果是有目共睹的。但有时候他给予的太多，朋友索取太多，以至于他不能顾到自己。

这两个不同面的想法反映出Reid一个经典的柔术策略：把你的弱点变成优势。例如，如果你是一家初创公司，担心缺乏业绩记录是一种负担，与其希望它消失，不如弄清楚如何在向客户营销时将你的新鲜感转化为优势。

就个人层面来说，这就需要每个人善于将缺点变成优点。觉得自己写东西不行？不妨提高摄影技术。思考速度不够快？那就侧重于深思熟虑，做一个细心、细节导向的人。

Reid和马克·扎克伯格在2013——2014年花了很多时间关注移民改革。有起有落，真正改革的斗争还在继续，但一个亮点是领英为“DREAMer”移民举办了一场黑客马拉松。这非常鼓舞人心。



![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/WNcLia53ZSnnAkJs802skTlVBicopgeHud9AaEDQmR2ZNXTl6cWialme8SZlp9kyYia9d0CZK7ibWSVLvwUSsgK79Rg/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)



真正塑造出企业文化的价值观兼具优点和缺点。




许多公司都有一长串积极的价值观：正直、卓越，勤奋等等。Reid表示，这些价值观可以贴在海报上，挂在公司的自助餐厅里，但它们并不能真正定义一种文化。重要的价值观，提供了清晰的优点和缺点。

正如没有风险就没机会一样，任何决定性价值观，也都会给公司带来负面效果。

例如，在领英的早期，还没有洗脑的文化。内部谈论的并不是“我们注定要伟大”。当事情进展不顺利时，Reid会与高管和员工谈论这件事。这种实话实说的好处是，它可以带来有益的反思。整个公司可以围绕关键挑战一起解决问题。这种方法的缺点与士气有关。事实上，一些非常有才华的人很早就卖掉了他们的股票，离开了公司，因为他们认为公司没有未来。一个决定性的文化特质是：整个公司的好与坏都完全透明。

PayPal 的一个文化特质是：“让最好的想法获胜。”不是PayPal的任何答案或想法都能直接采用。相反，提出这个想法的人必须为此进行激烈的辩论，并经受住同事们的批评。这样开诚布公的文化，好处在于：严谨的分析能产生更好的想法，而不是“这是一贯的做法”或“CEO都同意了”。缺点是：对抗性的人际文化会更强化工作关系而破坏了潜在的合作。此外，这种文化实际上是“反经验”的：对有经验的人来说，这种方式很难，因为他们必须再次证明自己。

PayPal一个更普遍的例子是，一家公司在决策过程中是专制还是民主。这往往是一个决定性的文化特征，即使你从来没有在任何一个公司的“关于我们（About Us）”网页上提到过这个。

我不相信存在“好的”公司价值观或者“坏的”公司价值观——除了显而易见的。许多不同类型的文化造就了不同的成功公司。重要的是理解实际影响公司行为的价值观，理解其中的利弊。所以你找工作时，也不要轻率地相信所谓价值观，你需要认真感受和理解，新工作环境的真正文化到底是什么样的。

理解人有不同的“Alpha”人格，并理解该人格如何驱动他们。




Reid经常通过 Alpha（阿尔法）人格的程度来分析人——换句话说，就是他们关注的层面，以及他们从传统的地位/权力中获得的乐趣。他们完全是阿尔法人格？他们有阿尔法倾向吗？他们是被压抑的阿尔法人格吗？

Reid将人分为三类：完全阿尔法人格，阿尔法倾向人格，压抑型阿尔法。如果你想在商业上有效地与某人合作，了解他们属于哪一种阿尔法人格是很有用的。

“完全阿尔法人格”指那些想要成为牛人的人，他们表现出所有典型的男性领袖或女性领袖的行为。完全阿尔法人格非CEO不做，即使这些职位并不适合他们。向这类人推销机会时，你需要强调的是他们的权力角色。有时他们对地位的原始欲望会影响到他们的思维，他们会忽视对他们长期利益有帮助的路径。

“阿尔法倾向人格”有阿尔法特征，但他们能管住自己的控制欲。Reid把我归到这类人中，我想他也会把自己归为这类人。他管理自己阿尔法的能力，一定上解释了为什么他能和杰夫•韦纳在领英合作得如此顺利。同样的，杰夫也能接受充满智慧且有影响力的公司创始人担任董事长，这也不是每一个 CEO 都能忍受的。两个人都才华横溢，双方都以合作方式管理好自己的阿尔法倾向，使他们史诗般的伙伴关系蓬勃发展。

“压抑型阿尔法”是那些渴望地位却自认为没有这种渴望的人。典型的老好人有时就属于这一类。对这类人，要容纳他们无意识的权力需求。如果他们觉得自己没有得到应有的尊重，他们有时会做出反动的行为。他们可能会直截了当地，出人意料地试图在没有出现任何特别情况下维护权力或地位——这让人们感到意外，但这是被压抑的阿尔法倾向释放出的短暂、混乱的表现。

自我欺骗的本性：即使那些嘴上说他们不需要被奉承的人，内心却很诚实




我在其他地方写过关于为什么要谨慎地对待别人对自己动机和能力的描述。这是因为自欺是人性的一部分。我们是自己人生故事里的英雄，我们总是认为自己的优势更加明显。我们夸大了自己的力量。

Reid读书时研究过自欺行为，他还为一些特定的人建立相应的心理模型，他们的自我认知和现实之间存在差距。一个典型“口是心非”的例子就是奉承。

Reid曾经跟我分享过一个关于罗伯特的故事。罗伯特极度渴望与能力更强大的保罗建立联系——他们都是Reid的朋友。保罗在当今的软件业中确实是一个非常有地位的人。当罗伯特和保罗一起做一个项目时，双方却互相抵触，一定程度上他们处不来。罗伯特不明白这其中的原因。

许多成功者认为自己不需要任何人的表扬和赞赏。Reid说保罗现在是这个行业的传奇人物，他也是这么认为的。“赞美对我不起作用”。 保罗说，恭维对他已经不起作用了；他这辈子听过很多关于夸他智力的。如果你开始奉承他，他会说:“停，你没必要说我好话。我们都是同行！”然而事实上，Reid认为，保罗根本是在自我欺骗，他的内心其实期望人们夸赞他。在准备与和地位相比于他低的人合作时，保罗也总是期待着他的优越地位能够得到承认。

Reid告诉我，罗伯特没有大力夸奖保罗。罗伯特看到了保罗自谦的表面就没有再奉承他。很多男性领袖说他们不需要奉承或服从，但事实上他们需要。

(我要指出的是，很多人都认为奉承本身就是一种操作，但其实并非如此。奉承并不都是有目的的操纵，正如大卫·福斯特·华莱士(David Foster Wallace)曾经说过的，有一种东西是原始的、纯粹的，它也可以是即兴而善意的。Reid就是这样的，他可以做出这样的善举，包括不期待得到任何回报的赞美。为完成某些事情，你需要学会甜言蜜语，这是人之常情；其他时候，这是一种无目的的行为，源自纯粹的善良。）

区分你对每一件事的投入程度。




如果将你人生中的每一件事都比作是一个项目，这儿有区别项目投入程度的方法：

- **主导者**——是你在主导推进整个进程。你是那个让事情发生的人。你有控制的能力。

- **董事会成员**——你可能是个投资者。和主导此事的人经常会面。即使没有被要求，你还是会思考这个项目。你会不断地了解最新和最好的信息。

-  **投资人**——你是个这个项目的支持者（经济上或时间上），但你在项目中并不活跃。你只是和主导者偶尔见面。如果你被要求做某事，你能够帮上忙，但你并不用时刻跟进。

- **朋友**——你可以和这事儿的主导者偶尔聊聊。但离开了，你就不用再想着这个项目了。

当然，最低程度的参与就是，这事儿和你完全没关系。

下一次你参与一个项目时，考虑一下这件事和你的关系到底有多密切。弄清这一点，对你自己和其他人来说都很有帮助。



![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/WNcLia53ZSnnAkJs802skTlVBicopgeHudl8Is3sAOIzRrQnbJzGKiaqXmSnicxiabNZQ4o3CTNyvc2kGYlySWpCBZg/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)

为每个项目设想三种结果：最好、正常和最坏。要做最好的准备，最坏的打算。




Reid将人生中每一件事都比作是一个项目。他会认真搞清楚，自己在每一个“项目”里扮演什么角色，并且预判这个项目可能的最好、居中和最糟的结果。然后，再决定投入多大时间和精力。

如果一切顺利，甚至你运气还不错，眼前这个“项目”的可能结果是什么？你是会统治世界？还是会创造一个成功的产品？或者是，写出一本畅销书？如果即便是最好的情况，预期的结果也不是很吸引人，那么你可能不应该把这个项目排在第一优先级，或者至少你可以调整投资额。你正在做的事情能带来的必须是令人激动的好处。

如果事情进展顺利但不是很好，那么“正常”的情况是什么样子的？用高尔夫来比喻，如果你努力将球打到球道上，不是果岭，不是长草区，只是球道，会发生什么?

最次的情况，如果你的项目停滞不前或偏离预想的轨道，最坏的结果是什么？它会是致命的吗？比如，死亡（无论是在名誉上，经济上）？或者情况不会太糟糕，你可以挺过去？

当Reid、克里斯和我对《联盟》进行头脑风暴时，我们就设想了各种场景的可能。这本书需要投资很多。最好的情况会是怎样的，我们对此有何感想？——这个管理框架会被商界公司真正采用；而正常的情况会是什么样子的，我们对此有何感受？——书可能有人看，但是并不会有人真正采纳它。最差的情况呢？——这本书反而会给我们带来负面评价或者声誉损害。

当你将这三种场景逐一在眼前排开，你可以相应地调整你的期望和投入。

建立伟大合作关系的关键是： 发现并重视那些不一致的动机。




我和Reid共同经历的第一次谈判，是和我们的出版商谈《至关重要的关系》。Reid提醒我好好想想，我们和对方的思路在哪些方面是一致的，在哪些方面是不一致的。

即使在一个互利共赢的交易中，每一方的出发点也有不一致之处。

例如，在我们和兰登书屋的合作过程中，对方的动机是卖书，而我们的兴趣则更宏大：无论以何种形式和代价，我们要向世界传递一种理念。因此，我们对免费赠送电子书更感兴趣。不过这种不一致并没有破坏这桩交易。但意识到这一点，将帮助我们更好地驾驭我们之间持续的关系。

让你自己和对方清楚地知道你与对方不一的地方，这样当对方抬起头来的时候，双方都不会感到惊讶。



![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/WNcLia53ZSnnAkJs802skTlVBicopgeHudiaodKcC8dsGqcggfzhRMrDTT4w8ylUYzufno9QmDKvVXc6pGE8PJoicw/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)

理性是方向盘，情绪是油门。想清楚方向再踩油门。




在正式与Reid共事之前，我曾和他在犹他州乡下与他参加一场晚宴。这是一次知识的静修，而我们俩恰好坐同一张桌子。根据晚宴的安排指示，我们围着桌子走了一圈，和桌上每个人分享关于世界的看法。Reid说完他的话后，桌上一位广告业的高管转向Reid说，“这个观点一点也不大胆，”他揶揄道，“多么令人难以置信的无聊预测。”接着他离开了桌子，在黑莓上敲电子邮件。可悲的是，人们对他的粗鲁并没感到意外——这家伙整晚都表现得像个傻缺。Reid平静地回复，“我完全愿意接受。”然后我们接着继续下一个环节。不是每个人都能在受到侮辱时还能保持沉稳的。

当然，测试并不总是关于你如何应对被当面侮辱，因为在礼貌的商务往来中很少有这种情况。通常，情绪上愤怒会通过一系列烦人的电子邮件或无聊的会议逐渐恶化。终有一天，骆驼被最后一根稻草压死，你发了一封不明智的电子邮件，或者在一个小组电话会议上吼出讽刺的话语，让电话变得安静。

Reid天生就不是冲动的人。这可能是故意控制，或者经过深思熟虑，又或者在面对波动时有所克制。许多人让情绪渗透进推理过程，而Reid却是整合他的情绪反应让其融入到推理过程中。对Reid而言，激情是理性的奴隶。(值得一提的是，这种性格与史蒂夫•乔布斯的性格正好相反——这也说明了有多种不同的成功模式。)

我想说，在做决定的时候，把理性当作方向盘，把情绪当作推动你前进动力油门。正如各种研究表明的那样，你需要情绪来果断地做出一个正确的决定，但情绪也需要理性决断的正确引导。Reid与其他擅长把方向盘转向正确的方向的人一样，通过理性在对的方向上放入适量的情绪能量。

我不确定知道学会引导和踩下情绪油门是否是后天培养习得的技能。或许这是天生的。

 

![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/WNcLia53ZSnnAkJs802skTlVBicopgeHudpHOrIicJAv3cAeyK3jDa9Wk5sqJfZeuibibHKCiasSMFiaTicAs0icw8sdWqA/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)

和能力强相比，值得信赖更重要。




要和朋友一起开公司吗？Reid表示可以，在其他条件相同的情况下，和信任的朋友一起能够前进得更加快速。因为你早已理解彼此的思维和说话方式。而行动迅速，几乎是创业早期的至关重要的生命线。

但假若其他条件不一样呢？如果你要在一个信任的朋友但能力为7分(满分10分)的人共事，或者一个能力9分(满分10分)的陌生人之间选择，你会选谁？答案是：如果你信任的这位朋友学习能力强，那就选择你信任的朋友。

以信任为筹码，即使这意味着以暂时的能力逊色作为代价。

换句话说，选择你信任但学习能力强的朋友，而不是你不认识的人但更有能力的人一起工作。假设你认识且信任的人处于永久测试版状态，他或她可以在短时间内弥补他们在技能或经验上的不足。

我个人也受益于Reid这种做法。对一些任务，我显然不是世界上最有资格的人，甚至不是他人际网中最有资格完成的人。但是鉴于：a）我们完全信任彼此，b）我了解他的偏好和价值观，而且他也了解我的偏好的价值观，c）我也是个快速学习者。我们可以共同以闪电的速度完成项目。

因为有了这么多的教训，我必须不断重新温习这种做法。我第一次尝到教训是在我早期的一家公司，当时我们雇佣了一个在行业成就方面看起来很棒的人，但我们都不真正了解或信任他。在我们踩到一些地雷的那一刻，缺乏信任毁了团队有效解决问题的希望。

第二次我是在另一家我与他人共同创立的公司里，经历了惨痛的教训后我才明白这一点的。当时我在引入一个团队成员时，过多地降低了团队成员的能力要求，因为我们彼此的信任都在那。这个家伙是一个快速的学习者，但在必要的专业知识上的舍弃是不值得的，因此项目陷入了困境。

实话实说，不要本能地去拍牛人的马屁。




在我开始担任COS一职后不久，Reid和我在帕洛阿尔托为朋友举办了一次晚宴。结束后，我开车载着其中一位客人查理·桑赫斯特(Charlie Songhurst)回了他住的酒店。我认识也敬佩查理很多年了。当时，他圆满结束作为微软公司战略主管和史蒂夫•鲍尔默(Steve Ballmer)顾问的职责。当我告诉查理我如何努力帮助Reid时，他告诉了我一些我至今都没有忘记的事：“我的工作基本上是告诉史蒂夫真话。你也要为Reid做同样的事。”我把这句话记在心里。Reid说，他也非常认可这个想法。

毫无疑问，你有多大的权力和有多少人拍你马屁之间存在着直接的联系。

像Reid这样的知识分子，寻找的是真理和智慧，而非追捧。那些不断追求专业进步和个人成长的人也知道，只有当他们得到建设性的反馈时，他们才会进步。然而，大多数人给的只是毫无意义的赞美(比如夸“你真了不起!”)。盲从地夸赞是没用的。

对像Reid这样的人实话实说，需要你们有非常紧密的关联。

如果你有勇气向有权有势的人实话实说地反馈，你就能赢得尊重和关注。

有一次，一位顾问给Reid和他在Greylock的一位合伙人发了封电子邮件，告诉他们，他认为他们在一次会议上的共同表现是“C等级”。这引起了他们的注意——他们已经很久没有得到C等级了！我觉得他们因此更尊敬他了。

另一方面需要注意的是：不管嘴上多么拒绝，每个人内心还是都喜欢“被奉承”。因此，提供建设性的反馈是一方面，而采取合理的方式又是另一方面了。

尊重成功人士背后的力量。




Reid和微软的CEO史蒂夫.鲍尔默曾一同参加丘吉尔俱乐部举办的非正式演讲。在演讲开始之前，我们对流程和内容做了一次梳理。当我陪同Reid一起走进准备室讨论时，史蒂夫立刻起身和我握手，主动报上姓名：“你好Ben，我是史蒂夫.鲍尔默，很高兴认识你。”他表现得非常正式，让我非常受用。

而一年以后，Reid主持了一位硅谷大佬的炉边谈话时，与他同行的是一位公关人员。硅谷大佬和我友好地打了招呼并和我聊天，但他随行的那位，却视我如同不存在一样。结束活动后，她也只是和Reid道别，然后就迅速和老板一起离开大楼。相较之下，她的老板的素养要比她好太多了。

谈论这件事，并不是因为我——我不会因为公关人员对我的态度如何如何就气愤得夜不能寐，但我要强调的是，和大人物做事的关键，就是任何时候都不能低估“背后力量”的影响——比如他的顾问、助理、咨询师甚至是配偶。对他们无礼，必定会在这个交际圈中失去和他们一起进步的机会。一个人越有实力，他的圈子也会越广，同样他的“影子力量”也会越强。



![Image](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz_png/WNcLia53ZSnnAkJs802skTlVBicopgeHudhGW62OYmKiaQEQC0Dwa6CfgRArKafiaUWiaSk3vswm3khAgX07G7KiauqQ/640?wx_fmt=png&tp=webp&wxfrom=5&wx_lazy=1&wx_co=1)

相处成真正并肩作战的伙伴，他们工作会更加努力。




在《至关重要的关系》一书中，我们将人生比作一场团队运动，所有伟大的事情，都是通过与人打交道完成的。Reid是一个整合人际资源的大师，他最擅长的事情便是乐于同他人分享项目。尽管他常常扮演着独特的关键角色——无论是主要召集人、投资者或者具有远见卓识的梦想家，还是承担部分执行工作，他都慷慨地分享功劳。

这并不单单是在项目结束后，和大家象征性地说声感谢，而是要在项目执行中，让团队成员获得充分信任。当人们意识到他所做的事情时，自然会为他的慷慨所动容。或者他们会称赞他，因为他保证了每个辛勤工作的人都得到了回报。

但他真正的优点是智慧。他具有包容性，因为他深知当人们将个人成就与工作成功联系起来时，他们会更努力地工作，会更关注项目，最终的产品也会受益（同时也有利于他的声誉）。Reid和Greylock的合伙人、领英的高管们是这样做的，我和Reid在我们合著的两本书的过程里也是这样做的。作为一个合著者，而不是一个代笔人，我觉得我对这个项目的投入远远超过了我本应该做的，质量也相应提高了。

因此，每当我看到那些创业者不愿分享胜利果实，当初打天下的早期创始团队成员，甚至连个联合创始人到头衔也得不到，我常会感到非常诧异。他们的自我，让他们作茧自缚，忘记了作为一个创始人真正的使命是什么。

通过分享荣誉，让别人成为你真正的伙伴，你将提升团队成员的主观能动性及责任感，这会让你走得更快更远。

你周围的人以无数难以觉察的方式，改变着你。




上述的几个经验教训都非常具有启发性，但它们都是互不相关也很具象的。他们都是有限的。

然而，当我回顾过去四年半的经历时，我从Reid身上学到的东西更包容万象，远不止这些经验教训。和优秀的人在一起，学习是无处不在的。当你完全沉浸在另一个人的生活方式中，当你的工作从某一角度来说是每天站在他的视角看世界时，那个人对你的影响就变得非常关键，而且这种影响将绵延持续。

这让我想起了我曾采访的职业运动员们，当谈到他们最重要的教练时，他们说，他们和教练学习到的不仅仅是如何击球、投球或接球，而是学会如何打好每一场比赛。

所以，最重要的一课是：和你相处时间最长的人会以你无法预料、甚至不易觉察的方式改变你。

人生最重要的决定就是选择什么样人在你的身边。

能从像Reid这样一个特别的人身上学到这么多，我感到无比幸运。

愿你我都有这样的幸运，有机会与生命中那些特别的人成为伙伴，并向他们学习。也祝愿你我都有机会能够品味这个神奇的世界，并且有这个智慧去稍稍改变它，哪怕只是一点点。

We touched down in Las Vegas only three hours before, but we were already back in the plane and flying home to San Jose on a brisk winter day in December, 2012. Not having to go through security at an airport saves a lot of time.

Other than the two pilots in the front, Reid and I were alone, debriefing what worked and what didn’t at the tech event where he had just spoken. I gave some quick feedback on the answer he offered to a question about LinkedIn’s vision. He re-played his answer on how Greylock differed from other venture capital firms. I took notes.

The conversation then shifted, as it increasingly did those days, to a different line of inquiry: Did this trip to Vegas advance an important professional project? Did he have fun? Or both?

Every decision has tradeoffs: when you choose to do one thing it means you choose not do some other thing. When you choose to optimize a choice on one factor, it means necessarily suboptimizing on another factors. Reid faced tradeoffs in his life that were heavier than the ones you or I face. Imagine you could meet anyone, from the President of the United States on down. Do almost anything you can think of – from saving the local opera company from bankruptcy to traveling to the farthest outposts on earth in total luxury. A small number of humans have virtually no constraints on their decision-making, and Reid is one of them. When Reid chose to fly to Las Vegas and speak at this event, the list of things he chose *not* to do with that time was very, very long.

Often, Reid wrestled with these tradeoffs. Author E.B. White once captured the essence of why. *“I wake up in the morning unsure of whether I want to savor the world or save the world,”* White said*, “This makes it hard to plan the day.”*

For some, *savor* is the easy answer to the task of planning a life. For those with no constraints, the plan is often straightforward: they put their name on a few buildings of their alma matter, buy a pro sports franchise, and call it a day. For the 99% of people with resource constraints, they might bag a 9-5 job, accumulate vacation days as diligently as possible, retire early, and maybe donate to their friend’s Walk Against Cancer. Reid likes to savor, albeit not hedonistically. Savor for him means arriving at intellectual epiphanies; it means spending time with friends.

But what he really wants to do is *save*. He wants to use his talent and network and money to change the world for the better and solve some of humanity’s biggest problems. He is among the most selfless and externally-generous people I’ve met in my life.

Decision making becomes hard when you want to do both. Which is it today: saving or savoring? Usually you do have to choose. It’s the very rare project that involves close friends and ongoing intellectual stimulation, *and* change-the-world impact.

That evening, as I sat across from him on the plane, he looked exhausted. The speaking event he had just done was in the “save” or “change the world” category—it would hopefully inspire other entrepreneurs, extend the [Greylock](http://www.greylock.com/) brand, and help build a couple relationships with folks in the industry. It wasn’t especially fun or stimulating and didn’t involve close friends. At that moment, I felt like he should be doing more stuff just for him. He’s worked so hard to achieve his success, why not kick back a little and play Settlers of Catan while drinking fine whisky in the south of France? Yet at other moments, after he meets with a dynamite non-profit that’s saving the lives of millions, I understand why he commits to helping, even if it leaves him drained by the end of the weekend’s marathon meetings.

The save/savor dilemma is one he’s still figuring out and probably always will be.

He’s not alone, of course. *All* of us who enjoy privilege in the world struggle with the dilemma on different scales. Myself, I wonder about how much energy I should expend on the billion people in the world who live on a dollar a day or less versus tending to and enjoying my own little inconsequential life. How much should I volunteer and donate to charity? What does it mean to lead a life of purpose larger than self, and is that something I even need to concern myself with? Should I feel guilty if I blow money at a resort in Thailand when people just hours away are starving?

Reid likes to point out false choices. For example, some ask if entrepreneurs should set plans or just be ready to adapt. False choice, Reid says: they need to do both. Should you have a small number of intimate friends or a large number of looser ties? Both. Indeed, one of Reid’s favorite quotes is from the great Jewish sage Hillel: “If I am not for myself, who is? And when I am for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?” One interpretation of the quote is that you must love yourself and yet you ought not to live *just* for your benefit. You should help others, too. Reject choosing between self-love and love of others: do both.

So I’d agree that the macro correct answer to the save/savor dilemma is: *both*. But in practice, at the micro level of an individual decision, we tend to have to pick one or the other. I believe tradeoffs loom larger than false choices.

This is one theme I thought a lot about while working with Reid over the past four years. In the pages ahead, I will elaborate on many other lessons I learned from him. But I suppose I should explain first: Why the heck was I on that plane back from Las Vegas in the first place?

# The 40% Question

In her 2011 profile of Reid Hoffman, Evelyn Rusli of the New York Times ended with a direct quote from Reid: “I’m functioning at 60% effectiveness,” he said. It was a startling final acknowledgement because the article chronicled the lengthy list of activities and accomplishments that made Reid the “King of Tech.” Given how successful he’d been over the past decade, you’d think he was operating at 150% effectiveness.

But I knew Reid wasn’t being facetious. I had just spent two years full time partnering with him on our first book [*The Start-up of You*](http://www.thestartupofyou.com/), which gave me a view into his life. In addition to his duties as LinkedIn’s executive chairman, Reid worked as a venture capitalist at Greylock, served on several private and public company boards, supported a range of philanthropic initiatives, and produced various intellectual artifacts, such as our book. And let’s just say that his flow of ambition and ideas was not exactly slowing down.

It’s a lot for anyone to keep track of. On top of all that, thanks to LinkedIn’s IPO, he was now a fixture on the Forbes’ rich list. Billionaire status introduces all sorts of social complications in your life, especially for a guy who wasn’t expecting it. Reid played Dungeons & Dragons as a kid, drove oxen in high school, and came out of college with the intent of studying philosophy as a professional academic. It would be strange if there were *not* some “scaling” issues on the way to moguldom.

The 40% question. That’s what I titled a presentation I delivered at Reid’s house in July, 2012. The thought experiment was simple: What would it take to bridge the final self-identified 40% of his capacity so that 100% of his cylinders were firing? How would the world be different and how would his life be different as a result?

With the Start-up of You done and published, I had some free time, and so we conceived a tour of duty for me to help wrestle with this question full time. It was initially set as an interim 6 month gig since neither of us knew exactly what I would be doing. It turned into two years. We picked “Chief of Staff” as the job title, even though there was no staff to be chief of yet and even though it’s a title that means different things in different contexts.

Here’s how I now list the position on my LinkedIn [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=659753):

*I helped conceive, build up, and then run a new organization to amplify and extend Reid Hoffman’s strategic priorities.*

*Working out of the LinkedIn and Greylock offices for almost two years, as Chief of Staff I was involved in many of the decisions Reid made across the different areas of his work: LinkedIn (where he’s co-founder/executive chairman), Greylock (the venture capital firm where he’s a partner), his philanthropic work, assorted public intellectual projects, and political/civic initiatives.*

*I also strategized and executed new, proactive initiatives to increase Reid’s impact in Silicon Valley, Washington D.C., and beyond.*

*I hired and managed a team of employees who staffed all of the above efforts.*

I loved working with colleagues at LinkedIn and Greylock and with Reid’s broad network of portfolio companies and organizations (for-profit, non-profit, and political). But my favorite part of the job was the late night 1:1 conversations with Reid like the one on the plane from Vegas, where I offered my best candid advice on whatever was on his mind and where I did my best impression of a consigliore-cum-interlocutor as he ruminated on the small and big questions animating his life.

A handful of months have passed since transitioning out of the chief of staff gig along with the publication of our second book together ([The Alliance](http://www.theallianceframework.com/)). So it seemed an apt time to summarize several important lessons I learned about life and business from Reid over three tours of duty: co-authoring Start-up of You, doing the chief of staff gig, and co-authoring The Alliance.

Note that I’m not going to get into the details of the work with Reid at Linkedin and Greylock and his philanthropy and so on, in part due to privacy and confidentiality considerations. Instead, I’m going to focus on some of the generalizable take-aways. I picked 16; there are dozens more, of course! (Also, If you’re interested in more specifics on the process of conceiving, writing, editing, publishing, and then marketing a business book, [here are my detailed lessons](https://casnocha.com/behind-the-book-lessons-publishing-business-book) and insights from the Start-up of You process.)

### **1. People are complicated and flawed. Root for their better angels.**

Too often, people classify someone’s competence or character in black and white terms. He’s brilliant or he’s an idiot. She’s got a heart of gold or she’s an asshole. He’s an ethical prince or a conniving win-at-all-costs hustler. It’s an unfortunate tendency. Expertise is always relative. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future, as Oscar Wilde said. People are complicated.

Reid is widely known as the ultimate connector. One of Reid’s underrated gifts in this regard is that he maintains very complicated portraits of the people he knows. He appreciates the full spectrum of strengths and weaknesses of a particular person. He’ll comment on a friend’s character flaw—say, self-centeredness—but in the next breath note one of their unique strengths. Flaws that cause others to completely disengage are, for Reid, “navigable” (to use a Reid-ism) en route to their better side.

Along these lines, Reid forgives mistakes in his friends. If you make a mistake (or three) or if a weakness of yours gets exposed–you’re not dead to him. It’s just another data point in a rich tapestry in a long-term relationship. A good friend of his once convinced him to make a special trip to New York to participate in an event. Later, I asked him how it went. “It was a foolish waste of time,” he replied. And yet, the very next week, he was on the phone with the friend and plotting future moves. He’ll rarely let a single failure or shortcoming overshadow your successes or noble aspirations. And he’ll always root for your better angels to prevail. It’s no wonder his friends are so loyal to him.

It’s a philosophy that reminds me of my late friend Seth Roberts, who [promoted](https://casnocha.com/2009/06/an-appreciative-approach-to-people.html) an “appreciative” approach to life. When evaluating someone, instead of starting with their weaknesses, first ask what’s uniquely excellent about them. When evaluating a study, first ask what we can learn from it, instead of jumping to a critique of the study’s flaws. Let an appreciative point of view imbue everything you do.

### **2. The best way to get a powerful person’s attention: offer to help them.**

As chief of staff, I reviewed thousands of requests for Reid’s time/attention/money. It was stunning how few requesters actually offered to help *him* on something. Amusingly, many requests were framed as if the asking party were doing Reid a favor by giving him the opportunity to help them: “It’d be fun to get your feedback on something I’m working on.” Reid’s so generous and so curious that sometimes it *is* fun for him to simply help you. But why not figure out what he’s working on and send an article of relevance? Or offer to share a perspective that could be useful?

Most people think there’s no way to help someone as famous and wealthy as Reid or Bill Gates. Let’s run the thought experiment. How could *you* help Bill Gates? Donating to his favorite charity won’t help. There’s no one you could introduce him to who he can’t already meet. Buying a Microsoft product won’t make a difference in the grand scheme. But the truth is, what Gates craves, and what you might have, is *information*. A unique perspective. An insight on something that’s happening in your corner of the universe. He can’t buy that off a shelf. If you can connect information you know to something Gates *needs*—suppose your 10 year-old cousin is obsessed with a new app that may reveal a new trend in computing—he’ll find it valuable, and you’re more likely to be able to build a relationship with him. At the least, it’s a powerful first gesture that’s the opposite of “gimme.”

Help first. Help first. Help first. It’s key to building relationships – even with the ultra successful.

### **3. Keep it simple and move fast when conceiving strategies and making decisions**

Reid is a strategist. But he’s not someone who can recite Clay Christensen or Michael Porter verbatim. In fact, Reid has never formally studied strategy and he rarely references the famous gurus. Instead, his views on strategy are hard-won through experience, and specific to entrepreneurial contexts: situations where the overall battlefield is foggy, the ground underneath you is shifting, and death is assured if your next step is not the right one. Of course, in the “age of the unthinkable” (the title of one of his favorite books), this increasingly describes the battlefield *all* organizations are fighting in, not just startups.

***Speed\***

His first principle is speed. His most tweeted quote ever is, “If you aren’t embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late.” His second most tweeted quote ever is, “In founding a startup, you throw yourself off a cliff and build an airplane on the way down.”

Practically, he employs several decision making hacks to prioritize speed as a factor for which option is best—and to speed up the *process* of making the decision itself. When faced with a set of options, he frequently will make a provisional decision instinctually based on the current information. Then he will note what additional information he would need to disprove his provisional decision and go get that. What many do instead – at their own peril – is encounter a situation in which they have limited information, punt on the decision until they gather more information, and endure an information-gathering process that takes longer than expected. Meanwhile, the world changes.

If you move quickly, there’ll be mistakes borne of haste. If you’re a manager and care seriously about speed, you’ll need to tell your people you’re wiling to accept the tradeoffs. Reid did this with me. We agreed I was going to make judgment calls on a range of issues on his behalf without checking with him. He told me, “In order to move fast, I expect you’ll make some foot faults. I’m okay with an error rate of 10-20% — times when I would have made a different decision in a given situation – if it means you can move fast.” I felt empowered to make decisions with this ratio in mind—and it was incredibly liberating.

Speed certainly matters to an extreme degree in a startup context. Big companies are different. Reid once reflected to me that the key for big companies like LinkedIn is *not* to pursue strategies where being fastest is critical—big companies that adopt strategies that depend on pure speed battles will always lose. Instead, they need to devise strategies where their slowness can become a strength.

***Simplicity\***

His second principle is simplicity—simplicity enables speed. In situations where there are many paths, he frequently groups the possible options into “light, medium, heavy” or “easy, medium, hard.” For example, we were debating different ways to publish and promote the LinkedIn [Series B pitch deck](http://reidhoffman.org/linkedin-pitch-to-greylock/) we created. We could simply click publish, share it on LinkedIn and Twitter, and see how it spreads. We could reach out to journalists in advance and give someone an exclusive, early look. We could write a series of supplementary essays that appear simultaneous with the deck. We could audio record his oral commentary on each slide. Reid bucketed the options into three categories: basic, intermediate, and advanced. “How intensively do we want to go after this?” We decided on a level of intensity and executed on the relevant set of actions.

When there’s a complex list of pros and cons driving a potentially expensive action, Reid seeks a single decisive reason to go for it—not a blended reason. For example, we were once discussing whether it’d make sense for him to travel to China. There was the LinkedIn expansion activity in China; some fun intellectual events happening; the launch of The Start-Up of You in Chinese. A variety of possible good reasons to go, but none justified a trip in and of itself. He said, “There needs to be one decisive reason. And then the worthiness of the trip needs to be measured against that one reason. If I go, then we can backfill into the schedule all the other secondary activities. But if I go for a blended reason, I’ll almost surely come back and feel like it was a waste a time.” He did not go on the trip. If you come up with a list of many reasons to do something, Nassim Taleb once wrote, you are trying to convince yourself—if there isn’t one clear reason, don’t do it. (An analogous belief Reid has about consumer internet business models: there’s generally one main business model. Listing a blend of possible revenue streams makes investors nervous. LinkedIn is the exception that proves this rule!)

Making the complex simple does not mean ignoring the complexity. Reid is a nuanced thinker who does not shy away from detail, second order effects, exception cases, and so on. But especially in a group decision making process where there’s various points of views, it’s important for the leader to distill and frame the option set with simplicity. Wrestle with complexity, yes, but frame and commit to a decision that’s simple enough for everyone to understand and act on.

Simplicity also can translate into focus. He once told me about a frustrating conversation he had with someone at a startup who mapped a multi-phase vision for a project that stretched out a couple years. “He didn’t get it,” Reid told me, “If you don’t get Phase 1 right, you’re dead. Nothing else matters. *Nothing else matters*. He should be completely focused on nailing Phase 1.” There are going to be fires all over the place. Keep it simple: just focus on the one, most important fire.

***Empowerment: Have Those Close to the Ground Modify the Strategy\***

A lot of strategists (and CEOs) think that their job is to conceive a strategy and then hand it off to the underlings to execute. They might concede that delegation matters, but usually as a matter of execution more than strategy.

Reid disagrees. He once told me, “Whoever is actually immersed in the actual execution of a strategy should always think of ways to tweak the strategy for the better.” It’s a litmus test for talent: How do you know if you have A-players on your project team? You know it if they don’t just accept the strategy you hand them. They should suggest modifications to the plan based on their closeness to the details. And as they execute, they should continue to tweak the strategy, and you (the owner) should not feel a need to micromanage or second guess—if you do, you’ve got the wrong person.

### **4. Every weakness has a corresponding strength**

I sat down with Reid one day and shared a self-evaluation of my work, my goals, and my strengths and weaknesses. When I discussed how to compensate for certain weaknesses, he told me, “Most strengths have corresponding weaknesses. If you try to manage or mitigate a given weakness, you might also eliminate the corresponding strength.”

He shared a personal example about himself. He is not particularly well organized. But perhaps his day-to-day chaos partially enables his creativity. Creativity involves connecting disparate ideas. The man is a non-stop generator of ideas — perhaps the unstructured tempo of his life is a positive enabling force. How intensely organized you are and how creative you are may be two opposite sides of the same coin.

Another example: his loyalty and generosity with friends is a strength. Friends are so important to him, and he to his friends, and the stellar results of his collaborations with friends are for all to see. But sometimes he gives too much and sometimes his friends take too much and it pulls him away from taking care of *himself*.

This two sided coin idea informs one of Reid’s classic strategy jujitsu moves: turn your weakness into a strength. For example, if you’re a startup and worry your lack of a track record is a liability, instead of wishing it away, figure out how to turn your newness into a strength when marketing to customers.

On an individual level: Not a good writer? Be great on camera and with video. You aren’t a fast thinker? Be known as deliberate, careful, detail-oriented. And so on. Here’s a [good post](http://zenhabits.net/attack-your-limitations-turn-your-weaknesses-into-strengths/) on how to re-frame other limitations as strengths.

There were ups and downs and the fight for real reform continues, but a highlight was Linkedin hosting a hackathon for “DREAMer” immigrants. They were inspiring.

### **5. The values that actually shape a culture have both upside and downside**

A lot of companies maintain a list of values that are all sweetness and light: integrity, excellence, hard work, and so on. Those are fine values to put on posters and hang in the corporate cafeteria, but they aren’t what *really* define a culture, says Reid. The values that matter offer clear pros and cons, clear upside and downside. Just as there’s no great opportunity without risk, there’s no decisive culture-shaping value that also doesn’t have drawbacks.

In the early days of LinkedIn, for example, there was no kool-aid drinking. The internal narrative was *not* rah-rah-rah we’re-destined-for-greatness. When things weren’t going well, Reid and the execs and employees talked about it. The upside to this honesty-first approach was that it led to useful introspection. The entire company could collectively problem solve around the key challenges. The downside to this approach had to do with morale. Indeed, some very talented people sold their stock early and left the company because they didn’t think the business had a future. A decisive cultural trait: full transparency with the entire company about both the good and bad.

At PayPal, one cultural trait was: “Let the best idea win.” No answer or idea at PayPal would be taken at face value. Instead, the idea’s proprietor had to argue vigorously and withstand critiques from colleagues. The upside: analytical rigor tends to produce better ideas than “this is the way it’s always been done” or “the CEO said so.” The downside: a confrontational interpersonal culture can stress relationships at work and undermine possible collaboration. Moreover, this cultural undercurrent was effectively “anti-experience”: it was a harder place for experienced people to operate because they had to re-prove themselves.

A more general case of the PayPal example is the extent to which a company is autocratic versus democratic in its decision making. This tends to be a defining cultural trait even though you’ll never see it noted on a company’s “About Us” web page.

I don’t believe there are “good” corporate values or “bad” corporate values–beyond the obvious. Many different types of cultures have produced successful companies. What’s important is to understand the values at work that *actually* shape your company’s behavior and to understand the tradeoffs involved. And if you’re applying for a job at someone else’s company, be sure you understand the *true* culture that you’d be working in.

### **6. Understand someone’s “alpha” tendencies and how that drives them**

Reid sometimes parses people by how “alpha” they are—in other words, their level of focus on, and the pleasure they take from, traditional markers of status / power. Are they totally alpha? Do they have alpha streaks? Are they a repressed alpha? I’ve heard Reid put men and women in each of these three buckets. If you want to effectively partner with someone in business, it’s useful to understand where on this spectrum they fall.

A “total alpha” is someone who needs to be the top dog and exhibits all the stereotypical alpha male/alpha female behavior. Classically, total alphas need to be CEO or the highest possible job title, even if those positions aren’t the best fit for them. When selling someone in this camp on an opportunity, emphasize their power role. Keep in mind that sometimes their raw hunger for status will overpower their thinking and they’ll neglect paths that would better serve their long term self-interest.

Someone with “alpha streaks” has alpha tendencies but can manage them. He put me in this camp and I think he’d put himself here, too. His ability to manage his alpha streaks partly explains why his partnership with Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn has worked well. Reid was able to acknowledge he needed to hire a CEO to replace himself, which is not a realization every founder can come to terms with. Jeff was comfortable having a smart, influential founder still active at the company as executive chairman, which is not a dynamic every CEO can stomach. Both are supremely talented; both have managed their alpha tendencies in such a way that enable their epic partnership to flourish.

A “repressed alpha” is someone who craves status but *thinks* he doesn’t. Classic do-gooders sometimes fall into this category. For folks of this disposition, remember to accommodate their unconscious alpha instincts. And expect them to sometimes engage in reactionary behavior if they don’t feel like they’re getting the respect they deserve. They may bluntly and surprisingly try to assert power or status apropos of nothing in particular—it takes people by surprise, but it’s the momentary, messy manifestation of repressed alpha tendencies.

### **7. Self-deception watch: Even people who say they don’t want or need flattery sometimes still need flattery.**

I’ve written [elsewhere](https://casnocha.com/2010/04/distrusting-selfanalyses.html) about why to be wary of relying on someone’s own description of their motivations and abilities. That’s because self-deception is part of human nature. We cast ourselves as heroes in our own life stories. We wrap self-serving narratives around the things that happen to us. We overstate our strengths.

Reid is a student of self-deception behavior and builds mental models for specific people and the areas where there tends to be a gap between their self-perception and reality. One common case of this has to do with flattery.

Reid once told me a story about someone we’ll call Robert. Robert was struggling to build a relationship with someone we’ll call Powerful Paul — both friends of Reid. Powerful Paul is indeed a very powerful person in the software industry today. Robert and Paul were working on a project, but they were butting heads. They weren’t getting along. Robert didn’t understand why.

Many of the super successful class think they are “over it” in terms of receiving praise and awards. Reid explained that Paul, now a legend in the industry, has this self-conception. Compliments do nothing for him anymore, Paul says; he’s heard enough nice things in his life about his intelligence. Begin to flatter him and he’ll say, “Oh stop, you don’t need to say those nice things about me. Come on–we’re peers!” Actually, Paul is deceiving himself. Paul expects people to kiss his ring. Paul expects some amount of deference or due recognition of his superior status before he’s ready to partner with a lower status professional.

Robert wasn’t kissing the ring, Reid told me. Robert accepted Paul’s assertion of humility at face value. A lot of alpha males say they don’t need the flattery or deference when in fact they do.

(Now, I should note, a lot of people think flattery is inherently manipulative. But it doesn’t have to be. As David Foster Wallace once put it, “There is such a thing as raw, unalloyed, agenda-less kindness.” Reid, for one, can practice such acts of kindness, which sometimes include extending praise without expecting anything in return. Flattery is sometimes a tool you must employ to get something done; other times it’s an agenda-less act that flows from pure kindness.)

### **8. Be clear on your specific level of engagement on a project**

Here’s a handy way to categorize different types of engagement on a given project. Reid uses this shorthand.

1. Principal – You’re driving the process. You’re the person making things happen. You have ball control.
2. Board Member – You’re probably an investor. You’re regularly meeting with the principal. You’re thinking about the project even when you’re not formally scheduled to be doing so. You’re continually up to speed on the latest and greatest.
3. Investor – You’re a supporter (financially or with periodic bursts of time), but you’re not actively involved in the project. You’ll meet with the principal occasionally. If you’re called to do something, you have enough context such that you can be helpful on a reactive basis, but you won’t have up to date knowledge.
4. Friend. You enjoy talking to the principal. But the moment you walk away from the breakfast or lunch – that’s it. You’re not thinking about it anymore.

Of course, the lowest level of engagement on a project is no engagement.

Next time you decide to get involved with an idea, which tier of engagement will you commit to? Clarifying this for yourself and for the other party involved can be super helpful.

### **9. Sketch three possible outcomes for a project:** **the likely upside, likely ‘regular’, and likely downside scenarios.**

If everything clicks and you even get a bit lucky, what’s the likely outcome of your project? World domination? A successful product launch? A bestselling book? If this “upside” case isn’t very compelling, you might not want to embark on the project in the first place—or at least you might calibrate the level of investment. The upside case for what you’re working on needs to be exciting.

If things go fine but not great, what’s the ‘regular’ scenario look like? To use a golf metaphor, if you hit the fairway – not the green, not the rough, just the fairway – with your effort, what happens?

If your project stalls or goes sideways, what’s the downside case look like? Is it mortal – i.e., are you dead (reputationally, financially, etc.) Or is the downside quite survivable?

When Reid, Chris and I brainstormed The Alliance book project, we talked through these scenarios. The book was going to take substantial investment. What would the upside case look like (broad impact with real companies adopting the management framework) and how would we feel about that? What would the fairway scenario look like (a flash-in-the-pan impact with no real implementation) and how we would feel about that? What would the downside look like (negative reviews, reputational damage)?

When you align around three simple scenarios, as a team, you can calibrate your expectations and investment thesis accordingly.

### **10**. **A key to making good partnerships great: Identify and emphasize any misaligned incentives**

The first negotiation Reid and I led together was with our publisher for The Start-Up of You. Reid reminded me to think about where our incentives were aligned with the counterparty and where they were misaligned. Even in a broadly mutually beneficial deal, there will usually be particular points of misalignment. For example, in our Random House contract, their incentive was to sell books, whereas our interest was broader: spread an idea into the world, in any format possible, at more or less any price. Accordingly, we were more interested than they were in giving away of e-books for free. This misalignment didn’t torpedo the deal. But being aware of it helped us better navigate the ongoing relationship.

Make misalignments explicit with yourself and the other party so that if and when they rear their head, neither side is surprised.

### **11. Reason is the steering wheel. Emotion is the gas pedal.**

I was once at a dinner with Reid in rural Utah, prior to formally working with him. It was an intellectual retreat, and the two of us happened to be seated at the same table together. We went around the table and each of us shared a contrarian opinion about the world—as per the instructions for the dinner. (Peter Thiel was co-hosting it.) After Reid said his bit, another person at the table – a high profile executive in the advertising world – turned to Reid. “That’s not a bold view at all,” he sneered. “What an incredibly boring prediction.” He then turned his body away from the table and typed out a few emails on his BlackBerry. People were sadly unsurprised at his rudeness—this guy had been acting like a jackass all night. Reid calmly replied, “I’m perfectly willing to accept that.” And we all moved on. Not everyone can remain composed when an insult is hurled at one’s face.

Of course, the test usually isn’t how you respond to being insulted to your face since that’s rare in polite business. Usually, emotionally enraging situations creep up incrementally over a series of annoying emails or brain-dead meetings. One day, the proverbial straw breaks the camel’s back, and you shoot off that ill-advised email or bark a sarcastic comment on a group conference call that makes the line go quiet.

Reid has a gift of being the opposite of impulsive. Call it being deliberate. Or thoughtful. Or restrained in the face of volatility. So many people let these emotions infiltrate their reasoning process. Reid integrates his emotional reaction into the reasoning process. His passions are a slave to reason, as much as it can be for a person. (It’s worth noting that this disposition is the opposite of Steve Jobs—which shows how many different models of success there are.)

I like to say that when making decisions, think of reason as the steering wheel and emotions as the gas pedal. You need emotions in order to be decisive in making a great decision, as various research has shown, but you also need to *direct* that emotional decisiveness in the right way. Reid is as good as anyone at steering the driver’s wheel in the right direction, and then deploying the right amount of emotional energy in that conscious direction.

I’m not sure if learning how to steer and press the gas pedal is a skill that can be learned or a temperament that can be cultivated. Or if it’s something more innate.

### **12. Trade up on trust even if it means you trade down on competency.**

Should you start a company with friends? All things being equal, Reid says yes, because you can move more quickly with trusted friends because you already understand how each other thinks and talks. And moving quickly? That’s critical in the early days of a startup.

But what if all things aren’t equal? If you’re choosing between working with someone who’s a trusted friend and a 7 out of 10 on competence, versus a stranger who’s a 9 out of 10 on competence, who should you pick? Answer: if the trusted friend is a fast learner, pick the trusted friend.

*Trade up on trust, even if it means you have to trade down on competency a bit*. In other words, choose to work with someone you know who’s a fast learner over someone who’s a bit more qualified who you do not know. Assuming the person you know and trust is in Permanent Beta, he or she can round out their gaps in skills or experience in short order.

I benefitted from Reid’s philosophy on this personally. For some assignments, I was not the most qualified person in the world, or even the most qualified within his own network. But given that we a) completely trust each other, b) I have a good sense of his priorities and values and preferences and he has a good sense of my own priorities and values and preferences, and c) I’m a quick learner, we could move at lightning speed together on projects.

As with so many lessons, I have to continue to re-learn this one. The first time I learned this lesson the hard way at one of my early companies, when we hired someone who looked great on paper in terms of industry accomplishments but who none of us really knew or trusted. The moment we encountered a couple landmines, the lack of trust ruined any hopes at productive group problem solving. The second time I learned this the hard way was at a different company I co-founded, where I traded down on competency *too* much when bringing on one team member. The trust was all there, and the guy was a fast learner, but the tradeoff down in necessary expertise wasn’t worth it, and the project floundered.

### **13. Tell the truth. Don’t reflexively kiss ass to powerful people.**

Shortly after I began the Chief of Staff job, Reid and I hosted a dinner in Palo Alto for some friends. I drove one of the guests, Charlie Songhurst, back to his hotel afterwards. I’ve known and respected Charlie for years. At the time, he was wrapping up a tour of duty as a head of corporate strategy at Microsoft and advisor to Steve Ballmer. As I told Charlie about how I was trying to help Reid, he told me something I didn’t forget: “My job is basically to tell the truth to Steve. You need to do the same for Reid.” I took that to heart. And Reid said he appreciated that.

It’s no surprise that there’s a direct correlation between how much power you have and how much people kiss your ass. Public intellectuals like Reid, who are on a hunt for truth and wisdom, are driven crazy by the nonstop ass kissing. Professionals in permanent beta—those who seek constant professional and personal growth—also know that they only improve when they get constructive feedback. Yet most people offer mindless praise (“You were amazing!”). Slavish yes-men are not useful.

So people like Reid end up relying on friends and colleagues who feel secure enough in their relationship that they’ll say what they actually think. If you have the courage to deliver honest feedback to a powerful person, you can earn respect and attention. One time, a consultant emailed Reid and one of his Greylock partners and told them that he thought their joint performance at a conference was a C in quality. It got their attention—they hadn’t received a C grade in a long time! And I think they respected him more for it.

Now, as per an earlier point, everyone enjoys being flattered, and indeed many successful executives still yearn to be liked. You need to deliver feedback constructively and not assume that someone powerful lacks basic feelings.

### **14.** **Respect the shadow power**

Reid and Steve Ballmer, then CEO of Microsoft, were set to speak on stage together at a fireside chat hosted by the Churchill Club. Backstage beforehand, we were reviewing the flow and talking points for the evening. When I entered the room for the pre-event huddle, Steve got up and extended his hand, “Ben, Steve Ballmer. Nice to meet you.” He was completely present. I was quite taken with how nicely he treated me.

Later in the year, Reid hosted a prominent Silicon Valley figure for a similar fireside chat. The man was accompanied by a press flak. The man himself said hello to me and chatted me up as friendly as ever. His flak did not acknowledge me—she pretended like I did not exist. And after the event, she said goodbye to Reid and then promptly exited the building with her boss. I found it telling that the main guy perceived me more respectfully than his flak.

This is not about *me*—I wasn’t kept up at night because some PR person didn’t acknowledge me. The point to those seeking to do business with poo bahs is to not underestimate the influence of shadow power—advisors, assistants, consultants, and most especially spouses. To be rude to them is to doom your chances at making progress with the man or woman at the center of the circle. The more powerful the person, the broader the circle, and the more the shadows loom.

### **15. Make people genuine partners and they’ll work harder**

In the Start-up of You, we write about how life is a team sport and that anything great in your life will only happen with and through other people. Reid is a master at bringing people together to work on shared projects. And even though he often plays a uniquely pivotal role, whether as key convener or funder or original visionary or even shouldering some of the execution work, he shares credit generously.

This doesn’t mean he issues obligatory thank-yous at the end of a project; it means he makes his partners fully credited co-pilots. When people take note of times he does this, they call him generous, which he is. Or they call him ethical, because he makes sure people who do hard work get credited for it. Also true.

But what he really is is *smart*. He’s inclusive because he knows when people are personally invested in the public success of a project, they’ll work harder, they’ll care more, and the final product will likely benefit (which also benefits his reputation). I’ve seen Reid do this with partners at Greylock, executives at LinkedIn, and with me in the two books we co-authored. As a co-author instead of a ghostwriter I felt far more committed to the project than I would have otherwise and the quality improved accordingly.

Along these lines, I’m often surprised when founders of companies shy away from offering the co-founder title to early founding team members. Their egos get them wrapped up in what it really means to be a “founder” and they forget that so long as it’s directionally true, you gain a ton in the way of motivation and commitment from those who receive the title. Share credit. Make people genuine partners. You’ll go farther faster.

###  **16. Final lesson and reflection: The people around you change you in myriad unconscious ways**

The lessons I’ve described above are all good and instructive, but they are discrete and easily describe-able. They are *finite.*

Yet, when I take stock of the past four and a half years, what I’ve learned from Reid feels more all encompassing than a tidy set of specific lessons. The learning feels more *infinite*. When you are fully enmeshed in another person’s life, when your job at one point is to look at the world from his perspective every single day—that person’s impact on you becomes so foundational that it’s hard to disentangle where his influence starts and stops.

I’m reminded of interviews with professional athletes, who, when reflecting on their most important coaches, say that more than learning how to hit or pitch or catch, they learned how to *play the game right*.

And so, there’s one more final lesson learned: the people you spend the most time with will change you in ways you cannot anticipate or ever fully understand after the fact. The most important choice of all is who you choose to surround yourself with.

I feel incredibly lucky to have learned so much from such a special man. May we all have the opportunity to partner with and learn from the special people in our lives. May we all take the time to savor this amazing world. And may we all have the wisdom to try to save it a little, too.
